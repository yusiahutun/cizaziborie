Not a lot has been reported about Audrey and/or her relationship with Robert, but that she met the band while they were performing in Dallas and was invited to travel the rest of the trips with them when Robert liked her. The two would have a monthly fling, and Audrey also become friends with the rest of the musicians while hanging around on tour. But, like most groupies, once the plane was set for home (England), so was Audrey (Texas). The song Hot Dog is said to be inspired by Audrey and there`s a story that she threw a drink at Jimmy Page in a bar once while clubbing. Some sources say that she was `just 17` when Zeppelin came to town, but there`s also an unconfirmed rumor that Audrey was in an `open marriage` at the time of hanging out with the band. What we do know is that Robert seems to have a preference for the brunette type (and for writing songs about every girl he`s involved with).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZoqaialafBbrzLmqWtZZGjsW6t1J2pnrFdna6utcutpqc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
