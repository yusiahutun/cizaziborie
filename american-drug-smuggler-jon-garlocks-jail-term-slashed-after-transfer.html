Garlock pleaded not guilty, but a jury convicted him and he was sent to prison for 24 years by Madam Justice Clare-Marie Beeson.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was sent to the maximum-security Shek Pik prison on Lantau Island and did not appeal against his sentence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In December 2011, he was granted a prison transfer and sent to a New York prison. In November, after serving just 11 months in the US, he was released.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the tracked him down at his parents' home in South Carolina yesterday, he was adamant that the Hong Kong legal system had wronged him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"The transfer is what enabled me to receive real justice," he said. "The US side reviewed my crime and if I had travelled into the US with that quantity of drugs, it would probably equate to an 11-to-13-year sentence."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The figure was further slashed due to "harsh conditions" that Garlock claims he had to endure in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I'm not real clear how they came to that figure, but the [prison] conditions took it down to eight years or something. Things like no heat or air-conditioning, no cool water, a bed that was too small." The worst thing was the food. "The poor-quality oil the food is cooked in is a real dietary health issue," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The US Department of Justice refused to comment on the case and a US consulate spokesman said prison transfers were carried out in accordance with the 1999 agreement.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Democratic Party lawmaker James To Kun-sun labelled the case "totally unacceptable".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"It's almost a back door to free a prisoner. If this case can have that result, the question to be asked is whether similar cases to the US will have the same result," he said. "Either we have to review the prison transfer agreement so that there are restrictions on the reduction of a sentence or we cancel the agreement."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Garlock first came to Hong Kong in December 2006 to start a mobile phone exporting business, splitting his time between his apartment in Prince Edward and Shenzhen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On July 6, 2008, Garlock and Tang - a man he had met two days earlier - flew to Vancouver to pick up suitcases belonging to a wealthy man in Hong Kong, according to court documents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Garlock said his air fare was paid for by someone else, but this was not unusual.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"The only catch was I had to bring back someone else's belongings. They said it would be easy and I wasn't suspicious at all.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I took the bags as my own, but because, according to the airline, I was responsible for the luggage I searched them."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Each suitcase had clothes, cereal bars and a plastic container marked "Lean Mass Gainer", a reference to protein powder. "They were sealed so I chose not to remove the seal," Garlock said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the pair landed in Hong Kong on July 12, narcotics bureau officers arrested them, searched their bags and found yellowish powder in each of the containers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Having never done any drugs, I didn't know what they looked like, but I would have thought cocaine was white. I thought perhaps it was HGH, growth hormones."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After his release Garlock moved in with his parents and hopes to become a car dealer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His wife of 20 years divorced him when he was in jail and re-married, taking the couple's four children with her.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I'm trying to back on my feet but it lingers, even for someone with lots of get-up-and-go," he said. "I would never go back to Hong Kong, not even if you gave me a million dollars."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong currently has prison transfer agreements with 12 jurisdictions: Australia, Belgium, France, Macau, Italy, the Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the US and Britain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Security Bureau spokeswoman said the policy allowed criminals to "serve their sentences in a familiar environment free of language barriers and where their friends and relatives can visit them on a regular basis".</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Drug smuggler walks free after US slashes jail term</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZomKusmZi5pnuQa3ByamZmfKK5xKugnJmeYrGzwcZmqqatl5y5pr6Mo6anZZeWv627wqSqZqKRnrluwMSrpGarnJbAqbHDZpifrJWnerW%2BwKeqn52i</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
