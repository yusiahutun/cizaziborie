She was raised by her mother who took her away after a divorce from her father when the actress was only 2 years old.</p><p>As a small child, Samantha Mathis spent a lot of time with her mother Bibi Besch, who worked as an actress in theatres and acting classes as well as on location. This should have a great influence on her life later on because she soon came to the film business at the age of 12.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Samantha-Mathis-1.jpg><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Here’s What We Know About Jeremy Wade’s Personal Life, Career, and Net Worth</a></strong></p><p>Apart from the fact that Samantha Mathis started acting at a young age she also took part in the advertising of baby products with her mother. Her first appearance was when she was only six months old when she appeared with her mother in a commercial for Final touch.</p><p>There is no information about the actress’s education and it is not known how far she has gone in this regard.</p><p>Nevertheless, she has achieved success when it comes to the film. She has acted in films such as Forbidden Sun (1989), Broken Arrow (1996), Museum of Love (1996), American Psycho (2000), The Punisher (2004), and Camilla Dickinson (2011). Her recent films include Duncan Skiles’ Clovehitch (2017) and Boarding School (2017).</p><p>Thanks to her role in “Pump Up the Volume” (1990), she has starred in over 40 films, short films, and television shows since her break. Before this time, however, she started acting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Samantha-Mathis-Bio.jpg><p>Given her recognition over the years, Mathis received a nomination for the Young Artist Award at the Young Artist Awards 1995. She received her next nomination in 1992 when she was nominated for Best Young Actress in This Is My Life.</p><p>Samantha was also nominated by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Films in 2005 for her role in Salem’s Lot (2004) (TV) for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>One of the best-known things about this actress is the tragedy she experienced with the death of her friend and actor River Phoenix, who died in 1993 at the age of 23.</p><p>Phoenix, was an actor and singer before he died of a drug overdose. This happened in the Viper Room on the Sunset Strip in the presence of Samantha Mathis and his siblings Rain, his sister, and his younger brother Joaquin.</p><p>The drugs taken by the actor caused him to convulse for over five minutes and by the time the paramedics arrived, he was already turning dark blue, in full cardiac arrest, and a state of immobility before he later died.</p><p>Although Samantha denied knowing about the actor’s drug addiction, many have always claimed that she was not completely honest.</p><p>When she talked about death years later, Samatha said that she found it “completely shocking”. It was difficult to imagine one’s mortality at that age. It is really strange to think now that I am not twenty-three and he will always be twenty-three.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Rahul Kohli Bio, Body Measurements, Height, Girlfriend, Gay</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Married, Husband</strong></h2><p>If you look at her dating life, the beautiful Samantha Mathis is not new to the game, as she has dated a whole range of men, even though she has no husband at the moment and has never been married.</p><p>The first person to date the 48-year-old actress is American actor and producer Christian Slater, and the relationship lasted only one year; 1989 – 1990.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Colin-Hanks-and-Samantha-Mathis.jpg><p>Samantha Mathis has also been involved with several men, including Adam Duritz (2004 – 2005), Noah Wyle (1995 – 1996), Christian Bale (1994), River Phoenix (1992 – 1993), and John Leguizamo (1991 – 1992).</p><p>Most recently, she had a relationship with another actor and filmmaker, Colin Hanks, and that was in 2009.
