Thanks for the insight and sorry for your loss," one fan wrote. Another commented: "You did a brilliant job in the documentary about your home. I'm sorry for your loss. I remember seeing the news about your Dad's killing but had not associated it with you. The programme was well balanced and thought provoking. I like your approach to the difficulties and wish that so many more people are like you."</p><p id=eUUeptYS7dl0><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Cat Deeley shares rare epic photo with Patrick Kielty at wedding</a></p><p id=e7-BhbtRi9S5 data-wc=70>The show started with Patrick returning home to County Down, Northern Ireland. He said: "My name is Patrick Kielty. I don't live here anymore, but I was born and raised in Northern Ireland. When I was 16, my father was shot dead by paramilitary gunmen. He was one of thousands of innocent people killed during the Troubles – the 30-year civil conflict that turned this place into a war zone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c61675d3c0eb-patrick-kielty-dad-coffin-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eMslwl9R62U_ data-wc=7><strong>Patrick's father was murdered&nbsp;by paramilitary gunmen</strong></p><p id=edsHz3GyoIY4 data-wc=33>"In 1998, ten years after my dad was killed, a deal known as the Good Friday Agreement brought an end to the bloodshed.

But Patrick said his family were not looking for any form of retaliation. "Everyone wants to believe that their loved one died for a cause. My dad died for nothing," he said. "He wasn't a political figure, he wasn't taking a stand, he had a building firm, he employed both sides… He was just doing the right thing." Of his father's killers, he added: "I can't forgive them. But whether or not these people are in jail, it's not going to bring dad back."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
