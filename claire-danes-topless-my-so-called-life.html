Posing topless and preserving her modesty with a trusty hand-bra, the 34-year-old actress puts her post-baby bod on display in the December issue. Danes welcomed son Cyrus with husband Hugh Dancy in December 2012.
And while she's a 3-time Emmy winner these days, she loves looking back at her past work."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"I became close with a lot of people involved—and I am still. It was a seminal experience for me, both professionally and personally."</p><p>In retrospect, she sees a lot of similarities between "Angela" and herself as a teen ... something she doesn't have on her current hit show, <strong>"Homeland."</strong></p><p>"That was wild because I was the same age as the character, and there was an incredible symmetry between us -- unlike Carrie Mathison [on "Homeland"], who in no way resembles me," says Danes. "I would be the worst case officer on the planet. I am so ill suited to Carrie's vocation. But Angela Chase was just another high school student."</p><p>It's clear the entire cast of "MSCL" has fond memories of being on the show.</p><p>toofab's<strong> Brian Particelli</strong> caught up with the stars of the show earlier this year -- watch the video below to see what they think their characters would be up to now:</p><p>And see how the entire cast has aged in the gallery above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnR7kGpmaWxfmLmitdGeZJ2ZnprAbsDOqaOeq6Niurp50qhknJmcobKlecuinZ5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
