Something not expected, as the older sibling is now first in line to the British throne.</p><p>Gloating about his 2006 graduation from Royal Sandhurst Military Academy, he gushed: “I was no longer Prince Harry, I was Second Lieutenant Wales of the Blues and Royals, the second-oldest regiment of the British Army.”</p><p>As Prince William joined the military later, he was still a training cadet when Harry became a Lieutenant. This was because Wills went to university, where he later met <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>. Whereas, the Duke decided to join the armed forces following a gap year.</p><p>Recalling the day which Harry holds close to his heart, he wrote: “The “passing out”, as they called it, took place on April 12, 2006. On hand were Pa and <a href=#>Camilla</a>, Grandpa, Tiggy, and Marko. And, of course, Granny.</p><p>“She hadn’t attended a passing-out parade for decades, so her appearance was a dazzling honour. She smiled for all to see as I marched past. And Willy saluted. He was at Sandhurst too now. A fellow cadet. (He’d started after me, because he’d gone to university first.)”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1144650215-1024x817.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-special-moment-between-harry-and-the-queen>The special moment between Harry and the Queen</h2><p>Prince Harry’s love for his granny peeks through his memoir throughout, and he mentioned how his military graduation ceremony became extra special as <a href=#>the Queen</a> herself attended it.</p><p>Harry revealed that the Queen was present for the passing out ceremony as she inspected the troops. “When she came to me, she said: Oh… hello. I smiled. And blushed.”</p><p>Harry added that the ceremony was extra special as the Queen also ended up giving a speech.</p><p>He then explained it was finally the moment when the ‘Spare outranked the Heir’ – with his military title trumping William’s.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2WAcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaaqK2cmbu1eceeo6llkqrBbq7LrqqhZaedsq95x55kn6GelrmtxYyorK2qkaO4prCMsKClpJmWunA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
