And, much like the C2 Pro, the C3 Pro contains a bevy of useful specs. Keychron C3 Pro's polling rate clocks in at 1,000 Hz, and <a href=#>n-key rollover</a> is employed to properly register simultaneous key presses. You also get software customization through the industry-standard QMK/VIA, which is extremely rare in affordable keyboards. Of course, this keyboard requires a wired connection, which is to be expected at $35.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Keychron's build quality is the big selling point here. Gasket-mounted keyboards tend to be fairly expensive, yet the C3 Pro uses a double-mounted gasket chassis with a layer of sound-absorbing foam. It should provide a very "expensive" typing experience with responsive physical feedback and pleasant acoustics. Presumably, it doesn't have the awful "pinging" sound that you'll find in similarly-priced mechanical keyboards. We still haven't tested the C3 Pro, so please treat this as an assumption.</p><p>This keyboard is illuminated with north-facing red LEDs, which shine through the legends of its double-shot ABS keycaps. Unfortunately, as you may have already guessed, the C3 Pro does not have hot-swappable switches (although the larger C2 Pro does). The lack of hot-swappability is a disappointment, but Keychron notes that the C3 Pro can still be a thrifty plaything for hobbyists or developers, as it uses a "high-performance" ARM Cortex-M4 32-bit architecture with 256K Flash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">purchase the Keychron C3 Pro</a> today at Amazon for $35. It supports both Windows and macOS, and customers can choose between red or brown switches. I suggest using the brown switches if you want a tactile feel, which gives you extra physical feedback and can prevent accidental key presses when typing. The red switches have a smoother response and are great for high-paced gaming.</p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keychron</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGiinrGTnb%2BwuoycamaooqR6qr%2BMmmRsbV2crrS3xK1kpqelo8GmsIymnJygkaO2pK3LZqKesZKkrrOwjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
