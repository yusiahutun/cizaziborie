However, on November 3rd, 2017, the senator was attacked by his neighbour in what appeared as bad blood between them. The argument arose over the senator's habit of leaving waste on the border of their gardens.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7067527ddde1e676.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Chris Isaak's wife? Here's everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>How was Rand Paul attacked? The senator's bad habit annoyed his neighbour, and the anger spilt into violence. He ran onto Paul's property and tackled him. The Republican politician was wearing headphones while mowing his lawn when he was attacked from behind. However, he managed to throw Boucher off of him, and they exchanged words.</p><p class=align-left>Boucher <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">testified in court</a> that he trimmed the branches on maple trees planted in Paul's yard near the property line he and Boucher shared. He said that the branches had been growing several feet into his yard and shrinking his yard space.</p><p class=align-left>Rene alleged that attempts to talk with Paul about the branches bore no fruits. He said,</p>I tried to, and I approached him, and he walked into his house and didn't want to have anything to do with me. ...

He collected the piles and removed them on multiple occasions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8601c7c1939bc9ee.jpg><p class=align-left>On the day of the incident, Rene said Paul was mowing his yard. He then realised that the Congressman had stopped to collect some branches and placed them in a new brush pile. As a result, Boucher ran out of his house hit Paul's ribs with his shoulder.</p><h2>What injuries did Rand Paul sustain?</h2><p class=align-left>According to an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">article published on Vox</a>, the state police said Paul had sustained minor injuries in the first reports. However, the senator's staffer, Doug Stafford, said Paul fractured ribs â€” three of which were partly or entirely cracked. On November 8th, 2017, the legislator clarified the nature of injuries through <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his post on Twitter</a>.</p><p class=align-left>He said,</p>I appreciate all of the support from everyone. A medical update: the final report indicates six broken ribs, and a new X-ray shows a pleural effusion.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9c05f56eebfa9ec5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Charles Stanley divorce: Is he married and what happened to his wife?</span></p></a><h2>Rene Boucher versus Rand Paul case ruling and sentencing</h2><p class=align-left>Boucher was found guilty and sentenced to 30 days in jail for the attack. He was also given 100 hours of community service and a $10,000 fine. However, prosecutors said that the sentence was too lenient and won the right to argue for a harsher one. As a result, he received an additional eight months in prison for the assault.</p><p class=align-left>Boucher was also ordered to pay the Congressman about $582,000 in damages in a separate civil case. He raised $482,000 from selling his <a href=#>house</a>.
