But the silence was deafening… The phone does stop ringing in your career, and you start asking yourself why. There are many reasons, but was this one of them? I think it was.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/827f10b1a528-brendan-fraser-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=edOy5vmoL4qK data-wc=6><strong>Brendan in George of the Jungle</strong></p><h2>Brendan Fraser's health struggles</h2><p id=eiqlJ8MB-EkV data-wc=72><a class=hm-link href=#>The star also struggled with difficulties surrounding his health</a>, particularly while filming He revealed that he&nbsp;suffered years of injuries from the stunts he performed in his various starring roles.

But none of it ever really clicked, it just didn’t move me, it didn’t feel right. <strong>A couple of years ago I caught a trailer from a low-budget Brazilian movie, I saw Brendan in it and a lightbulb went off."</strong></p><h2><strong>Brendan Fraser's marriage troubles&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=eFgJiw8-mBMH data-wc=50>Brendan and Afton Smith were married for nine years but calling things quits in 2007, with a publicist releasing a shared statement at the time saying that "they continue to maintain a close and caring friendship".
