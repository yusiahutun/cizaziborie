Other social media platforms are expected to introduce similar rules in due course.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 13-point rules say accurate sources must be used to provide news on domestic and international affairs, public policies and social events; fabricated stories or rumours must be marked out; and accounts must manage follower growth.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/09/09/bts.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:23</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Chinese social media site Weibo suspends K-pop fan accounts, including BTS follower’s page</p><p>Chinese social media site Weibo suspends K-pop fan accounts, including BTS follower’s page</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Chinese search engines and social media, information is often scrubbed, including immediately after natural disasters, to suppress public discussion or criticism of the government.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The name disclosure policy immediately sparked criticism online.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lao Dongyan, a criminal law professor at Tsinghua University and a prominent critic of government policies, wrote on Weibo that authorities should consider whether such a policy will be effective and whether people’s rights to speak anonymously should be respected.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Others fear it will pave the way to doxxing – the release of sensitive personal data online – and other forms of harassment. One Weibo blogger wrote that they already received threats as an anonymous user and was worried what would happen if they started using their real name.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But supporters of the changes say there is nothing to fear.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China censors economic, financial writer for ‘hyping up unemployment rate’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhuang Shilihe, a Guangdong-based medical and current affairs commentator who has 1.6 million followers on Weibo, posted that since influencers enjoy more exposure, they should take more responsibility, adding that people have a right to know who exactly is offering their viewpoint.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Those of you who don’t want to disclose your names … I suggest you switch areas,” he wrote. “If you were used to talking about international affairs, it’s still not too late to become a food blogger.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen Fuzhong, who specialises in data, media and online law at the Chengdu-based Tahota Law Firm, said the new changes did not raise legal concerns about privacy, but might discourage free speech.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Some might fear cyberbullying or other unnecessary troubles, and become more cautious when giving their true opinions,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">New media forms – including social media, short videos and live streaming – have replaced traditional print media and television as the primary source of news for many in modern-day China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But any hopes that online platforms might create space for more independent journalism away from the tight constraints on traditional media have largely been frustrated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead, mainly profit-driven public accounts, free from such controls, have helped spread misinformation and confusion.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2019/04/24/thumbnail_clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:33</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">How China censors the internet</p><p>How China censors the internet</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many people have also found themselves the targets of online hate speech and harassment, often based on false information, and there have been several examples of online influencers faking illness to raise money from their followers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, wrote in a 2022 paper that self-published accounts have yet to develop an ethical code in line with those that govern traditional media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chinese authorities have also launched repeated crackdowns to clear up cyberspace, but to little effect. This year alone more than 920,000 self media accounts were closed or penalised in a three-month crackdown that ran between March and May.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is not yet clear whether the new rules will solve this problem – from the government’s point of view – or create further trouble. But Fang said it was clear that the changes reflected the failure of self-regulation among social media influencers and platforms.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s Weibo mutes spammers for hijacking #Taiwan Strait drill topic</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said there were many ways for such platforms to enhance trust and safety, such as creating a friendly community atmosphere or strengthening restrictions on malicious content.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t think [name disclosure] is the best plan,” he said. “But this reflects the reality that if these social media platforms … don’t consider trust and safety, then they can only wait for the government to impose mandatory rules.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyxu8uiq6Kbo2Sus8DInKOeZ2NngHmDknJmnKqRmLilu9anZJqmn6PGrrvUrGScoJmjsrSxjKymnKGRoXquscOimGaZk5i8trrTrGShnZmctbWxzaxknKeemLKzutJmpq%2BdomK9s7XVmpqyZZGjsW6y0Z6cZqugmrKktA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
