The nostrils and the surrounding soft tissue (the alar area) have not changed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/meghan-markle-nose-job-6.jpg><p>Meghan in 2005 (left) and in 2017 (right).</p><p>However, other experts believe she’s never even gone under the knife and that she’s just naturally pretty — and quite honestly, we couldn’t agree more! <a href=#>Dr. Andrew Miller</a> says of the brunette, “If she had any work done on her nose, it is just a small amount of tip refining to narrow it slightly and lift it.” Keyword there is if.</p><p><a href=#>Dr. Adam Hamawy</a> feels exactly the same about Meghan’s face. He told Closer, “Meghan Markle appears to still have the same nose she was born with. She doesn’t look like she has had any plastic surgery to change the mild imperfections that contribute to her natural beauty.” So sweet!</p><p>He continued, “Any differences that I’ve seen are easily accounted for by her facial expression, makeup or lighting.”</p><p>In fact, Meghan doesn’t even like to wear a lot of makeup, and her favorite looks are when her <a href=#>freckles are “peeking through.”</a> Her former makeup artist, Lydia F. Sellers, recently revealed to Refinery 29, “Every time I’d do her makeup, she’d say, ‘Can we just make sure my freckles are peeking through? I don’t want a ton of foundation. It was more about the amount of product that went on her skin and keeping it really fresh and dewy, rather than caking it on.”</p><p>Wouldn’t Harry be so glad to know he’s about to marry a natural beauty?!</p><p>Join our <a href=#>Facebook group</a> for the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Prince William, and all things royal!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mnKCgkaN6rq3RpKOeZZ6kwKZ5yaiZZmlkZn53g44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
