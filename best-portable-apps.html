So if you wanted five folders, you would type "1,2,3,4,5" (no parentheses) into the text file. Save and close. Then with Text2Folders, navigate to the text file and start it. It will then instantly create five folders for you in the same location as the text file.</p><p>Obviously, you would have to rename the folders, but hey the folders have been made for you, which has saved some time, right?</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download:</strong> Text2folders for <a href=#>Windows 7</a> (Free)</p><h3 id=zip2fix><a href=#>Zip2Fix</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/zip2fix-portable-app-fix-archive-corrupted-670x401.png><p>.ZIP files (also known as "Zip" which is appended onto a file name) are awesome for collecting and compacting lots of files together. But Zip files get corrupted, just like any other computer file. So how do you try to salvage what you can, when a zip file goes bad? You use Zip2Fix.</p><p>With Zip2Fix, it will scan the corrupted (and therefore unopenable) Zip file, and see if there are any files able to be retrieved. If anything can be salvaged, it will extract those files and create a totally separate Zip file with them inside. You can then dump the corrupted Zip file, and see in the other one what has survived.</p><p>Zip2Fix ranks among the best portable apps around.
