The <a href=#>Virgin Atlantic sweatshirt she usually wore even sold for $53,532</a> last year. But have you ever wondered about the fitness routine she followed while donning the casual workout attire?</p><p>Although she was determined to fit exercise into her busy schedule, Diana‚Äôs duties as a mom always came first. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In Style</a>, Diana liked to start her days off with a quick swim ‚Äî but would skip that and simply do a few stretches before breakfast if Prince William or Harry needed her. Other than that, she would try to squeeze in at least three 30-minute gym sessions each week.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Jenni Rivett, Diana‚Äôs personal trainer for seven years, also <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>described her royal client</a> as ‚Äúincredibly dedicated‚Äù to the ‚Äúvigorous exercise‚Äù she‚Äôd plan for the princess. Diana clearly made sure she was getting the most out of her her half hour work outs!</p><p>Rivett hasn‚Äôt spilled more specific details on the types of activities the pair would do together, but you can follow her on Instagram to get an idea of the tips she likely gave to Diana. Check out one of Rivett‚Äôs favorite moves, which she recently shared in the clip below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>I think everyone knows this is my favourite move. . It's a great exercise to develop strength and balance ‚Äì especially focused on those muscles surrounding your knees. But it will also work that butt üçë‚Ä¶.oh yes .

For example, she claimed the pair‚Äôs ski trip to Vail, Colorado, one Christmas was done in order to help Diana deal with William and Harry spending the holiday season with their dad instead of her. We can definitely relate to how breaking a sweat can help ease a broken heart.</p><p>As for her diet, Diana was a big fan of nutrient-rich meals like her <a href=# data-type=post data-id=94170>favorite stuffed peppers</a>. According to former royal chef Darren McGrady, she told him, ‚ÄúDarren, you take care of all the fats, I‚Äôll take care of all the carbs at the gym.‚Äù It was her cheeky way of requesting that he keep her meals low-fat, but letting him know she‚Äôd still enjoy some carbs on the plate (which she‚Äôd work off with her exercise). We love how Diana embraced this healthy balance!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJoqaixkaHAcLzRoqWcnaOoeqW1wKeYZp6Zqbumv9I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
