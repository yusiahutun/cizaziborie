And although it may come as a surprise to some, the family say that their plastic surgery procedures are few and far between. Instead, their perfect appearance is thanks to great dermatologists, a stellar glam team and some good genes!</p><p>Here's what the Kardashians had to say about plastic surgery…</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6752bfd9-4089-4345-b25c-962b88e870bd data-container-ref=toofab:article:c0d2d881-ba0a-41d9-8103-b6d458d587b2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b6/5by4/2021/07/20/b623df4af44940a8a4f6d1ca4931691e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Khloe Kardashian Expecting 2nd Baby with Tristan Thompson: Timeline of Surrogacy & Scandal</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a></p><p>Over the years Kim Kardashian has shot down plastic surgery rumors, denying that she’s gotten a nose job or any other work done. Although she says she hasn’t gone under the knife, she does admit to trying out laser skin treatments like "<a href=#>vampire facials</a>" and occasionally <a href=#>getting Botox</a>. She's also done laser hair removal on her face and, post-pregnancy, she says had her stretch marks removed and her belly button tightened with a nonsurgical procedure.</p><p>"I've never had eyelash extensions. I've never done anything… I've never filled my cheeks. I've never filled my lips. My eyebrows are real…I'm 41. I always want to look appropriate. There does come a point when you've taken it too far -- overfilled, too tight, too much cosmetic work. There's nothing worse," Kim recently told <a href=#>Allure</a>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong></a></p><p>Like her sister Kim, Khloe Kardashian has faced neverending plastic surgery rumors, with some people accusing her of going as far as to get a "face transplant." Khloe says none of it's true and the only work she's actually had done is a nose job. Khloe admits she has tried fillers and Botox but has shied away from the injections because she "responded horribly."</p><p>"[Fillers] did not work for me. I looked crazy, and I still think the effects are in there. I went to have it all dissolved like three times. My face was so f---ed I had to go and get this whole thing dissolved. It was a bummer and now I'm afraid to do it again. And I'm almost like, I swear things are still in my face," Khloe <a href=#>shared</a> in 2016.</p><p>During an appearance on E!'s "<a href=#>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</a>" reunion several years later, she added, "For me, everyone says, 'Oh my gosh, she's had her third face transplant,' but I've had one nose job, Dr. Raj Kanodia, and everyone gets so upset, like, why don't I talk about it. No one's ever asked me."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4f8ba47a-49e5-4aec-978c-4a47a614b872 data-container-ref=toofab:article:c0d2d881-ba0a-41d9-8103-b6d458d587b2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ed/5by4/2022/07/13/ede098b0cc67471ba6211307de90e982_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Pete Davidson Reveals He Wants to 'Have a Kid,' Talks Difficult Childhood</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a></p><p>Kourtney Kardashian has faced her own set of plastic surgery accusations but the only procedure she has said she has undergone was getting a boob job when she was 22. Kourtney <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title="https://people.com/health/celebrities-who-regret-getting-breast-implants/?slide=2345419#2345419">says</a> she actually regrets the surgery and wishes she hadn't gone through with it.</p><p>The reality star also claims she doesn't even use fillers, <a href=#>shutting down</a> a social media commenter in 2019 who accused her of altering her face. Then in 2021, Kourtney denied that she had <a href=#>gotten a butt augmentation</a> when an Instagram follower wrote that she had gotten "plenty of surgery" including a "nose job, some sort of butt shot or bbl just to start."</p><p>"No better compliment than a 'too good to be real' kind of compliment. Butt shot and Brazilian butt lift? Um, thanks. And you were just getting started," Kourtney wrote back.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a></p><p>Kylie Jenner first opened up about doing injectables in 2015, when she began getting temporary lip filler. Kylie noted that in addition to filler in the rest of her face, a lot of her appearance is just really good makeup.</p><p>"People think I fully went under the knife and completely reconstructed my face, which is completely false. I'm terrified! I would never. They don't understand what good hair and makeup and, like, fillers, can really do. It's fillers. I'm not denying that," Kylie told <a href=#>Paper</a>.</p><p>In 2023, on The Kardashians, she continued to deny getting "so much surgery to change my whole face," insisting she's only done fillers. In a July 2023 episode, however, she finally confirmed she did go under the knife for a boob job when she was 19, shortly before the birth of her daughter Stormi.</p><p>"I had beautiful breasts, natural tits, just gorgeous. Perfect size ... and I just wish I never got them done to begin with," she said, expressing regret over the procedure before warning others against following suit. Added Kylie: "I would recommend anyone who is thinking about it to wait until after children."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:83d9c17a-645e-4bb7-a0f0-3b52292bdca2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:c0d2d881-ba0a-41d9-8103-b6d458d587b2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/71/5by4/2022/07/11/7105771251ce43d88816f374fd2eb085_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">North West's Special Effects Prank on Kim Kardashian Was Mistaken For a 'Murder Scene'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a></p><p>Out of all the Kardashian-Jenners, Kendall has remained the most mum on whether she's had work done. Over the years, Kendall has sparked rumors that she's gotten a boob job and lip injections but she's chosen not to respond for the most part.</p><p>One of the only times Kendall spoke out was in a video shared by Kylie, who <a href=#>shot down</a> rumors Kendall had gotten lip filler on her behalf.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a></p><p>Kardashian-Jenner matriarch Kris Jenner has been the most open about her plastic surgery procedures, opening up about what she's had done before and after skyrocketing to fame on "Keeping Up With The Kardashians." Kris admits that back in the '80s, she got a boob job but eventually got it reduced in the early 2010s.</p><p>"[I've had] Botox and fillers and laser and things like that. I had a boob job in the '80s after four kids because gravity took over…I felt matronly and nothing fit anymore, and suddenly, it was like get them out. So, the same doctor who put them in, he took them out, and then had to do a little lift and then put smaller ones in," Kris said on "<a href=#>E!'s Good Work</a>" in 2015.</p><p>Kris even went under the knife on her reality TV show, getting a neck lift while cameras rolled in 2011 and then getting a televised <a href=#>earlobe reduction</a> in 2018.</p><a id=gallery-link-bce0b35e-fc39-4ec8-9749-4a6199e9bc3f class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:bce0b35e-fc39-4ec8-9749-4a6199e9bc3f data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:c0d2d881-ba0a-41d9-8103-b6d458d587b2 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2b/4by3/2022/07/09/2bdaf365b5e8400ca36f2519da63b688_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3Bmam5fmsOmvtitn6Kml2LBqbGMpJirnJGotaqtzaxkoZmmmnq0rcidZJqan6rBbsDHnqCrZaChrrTAyJxkrK2inLKzxY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
