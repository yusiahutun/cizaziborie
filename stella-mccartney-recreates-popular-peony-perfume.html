"I get asked all the time: 'Where did it go? Why can't I get it anymore?' It's really a direct response to people wanting it and asking me about it, which triggered me thinking: 'Why not?' It just seemed like a no-brainer to bring it back."</p><p id=e0Zlr6Le0Sz data-wc=59>For the second incarnation of peony-based perfume, created with perfume licensee Coty Inc., Stella worked with Firmenich perfumer Alberto Morillas, who was tasked with making sure it didn't smell like an “old perfume”. The finished product includes top notes of mandarin, freesia and lotus flower; middle notes of pink peony and geranium, and base notes of amber and patchouli.</p><p id=eEe5fXDC3Y0><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: HELLO!'s beauty team unbox the best beauty advent calendars</a></p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=e7e_B4ioHrWa data-wc=5><strong>Arizona Muse fronts the campaign&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eBQU04wjklcq data-wc=96>Stella's sister <strong>Mary McCartney</strong> shot the advertising campaign, with model Arizona Muse starring in it. "(Working with Stella was so) inspiring!"&nbsp;Mary gushed. "She's always pushing the boundaries. We had a lot to achieve in the two days we shot over. Timing was essential. We paired stills and motion to capture the energy of a wide audience of strong women - the eight-plus stills complemented the moods of the three motion pieces captured. It was to be attainable, laid bare, on a journey, following a scent - vignettes of femininity at its most glorious, most dynamic."</p><p id=eiQ2CnzTwwwa data-wc=33>The scent will be available in Stella McCartney stories and on its website from 13 November, before it hits sephora.com for Cyber Monday on 27 November. It will roll out worldwide in January.</p><p id=eFDeUmXsSr22 data-wc=4><strong>See the latest <a class=hm-link href=#>health and beauty features</a> here</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKqkoZ6YrrOxjJqlnWWWp66ovsCnmp6rX2d9coOQamhsbGNugnV70q2cpaSRYrqkr8Crq6edqWK%2Fpq%2FRnpitnaNivbC81KWYq2WgmryvxYypnKuepaKycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
