He <a href=#>told “Page Six”</a> that he and Anderson Cooper won’t be taking shots on <a href=#>CNN’s broadcast</a> this weekend after all. “We aren’t drinking, but we’re going to have a BLAST,” he said. According <a href=#>to Variety</a>, CNN’s chairman and CEO told staffers last month that the year-end consumption of alcohol on air wasn’t a good look for the network. Initially, Cohen responded to the report by stating that he wasn’t one of the correspondents being asked to cut the booze. Earlier this week, he <a href=#>told Rolling Stone</a> that he would actually party “even harder” on behalf of his sober coworkers. Perhaps a fellow host helped him reconsider? Ryan Seacrest recently <a href=#>told Entertainment Weekly</a> that he supported CNN ringing in the year with less alcohol. “There’s some pretty respectable people or at least one, right?” Seacrest said. “I think there’s a serious journalist and then a friend of mine who has a lot of fun, but it’s probably a good idea [to scale back].” Cohen previously <a href=#>apologized</a> at the beginning of the year for drunkenly referring to ABC’s New Year’s Eve countdown as Seacrest’s “group of losers.” Maybe that sobering memory ultimately convinced him to sober up.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clc9rq3dj000m3b6vao76id52@published data-word-count=7>Original story published November 18, 2022 follows.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clc9rpnjg000i3b6vlox69mbv@published data-word-count=136>You may have feared the worst if you saw the <a href=#>recent headlines</a> about CNN making its New Year’s Eve countdown less boozy this year. But rest assured: Andy Cohen will be getting drunk with Anderson Cooper again. “My only direction is to have fun,” Cohen <a href=#>told People</a>. “That’s what I plan to do and I’m happy to cocktail it up.” It’s become an annual tradition for the CNN crew to get pretty loose on December 31. The often-comedic results — from Cohen <a href=#>throwing shade</a> at ABC’s NYE coverage to Cooper <a href=#>grimacing over tequila shots</a> to <a href=#>“no broke dick” resolutions</a> — are truly the reward we deserve for making it through another year. But <a href=#>according to Variety</a>, CNN’s chairman and CEO told staffers earlier this week that he thinks that on-camera drinking negatively impacts credibility and “respectability.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cland7zjv000m3b6wokm20qi4@published data-word-count=122>Variety’s report clarifies that Cohen and Cooper will still be allowed to consume alcohol, but Cohen doesn’t want to leave any room for doubt. Although he previously <a href=#>admitted</a> to being “a bit overserved” during last year’s broadcast, he <a href=#>promised</a> during Watch What Happens Live that this time, “Anderson and I are going to party harder than we have ever partied before!” On Twitter, he <a href=#>reiterated</a>, “We will be back. And we will be drunk!” Of course, that does beg the question — if Cooper and Cohen are safe, which correspondents or anchors might be in danger of being asked to sober up? It’s just a hunch, but we get the feeling that Don Lemon won’t be getting another <a href=#>live piercing</a> this year.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A word about New Year's Eve! 🍸 <a href=#>@CNN</a> <a href=#>@Andy</a> <a href=#>@andersoncooper</a> <a href=#>#WWHL</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4r5TQnBlys</a></p>— WWHL (@BravoWWHL) <a href=#>November 17, 2022</a><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Page Six</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>People</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Variety</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckxza3ebx0000ddogxn5z9c8q@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Andy Cohen Regrets That He Drunkenly ‘Slammed’ Ryan Seacrest on New Year’s Eve</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck4uwutfy0000u4ye71u7qfo7@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Let Don Lemon’s Drunken Antics Soothe Your New Year’s Anxiety</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckxvgub4j0000sjn1v8kqznd5@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>‘No More Broke Dick’ in 2022, Vows Dulcé Sloan on CNN</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjytkecca006zi9y6xjxyv65b@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper Face Off Against Desus and Mero</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Never Mind, Andy Cohen Isn’t Getting Drunk for New Year’s</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpa2dhZ3yiusOyZJynmJq7bq3NnZyrq5%2BjeqS7zqmcq2WemsRuxcSaqaxllauybrDRoqWkoZ6ceqS6zWefraWc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
