Her first TV role was in 1973 in the show Love, American Style.</p><p class=align-left>She later appeared on other shows such as Apple's Way, ABC Afterschool Special, Sara, Starsky & Hutch, and The Bionic Woman. As a teen actor, she once experienced <a href=# title="What happened to Kristy McNichol" rel="nofollow noopener">attempted sexual abuse</a> from the commercials director.</p><h3>Her stint on the Family series</h3><p class=align-left>The young Kristy joined Family in 1976, where she played Letitia Lawrence. She was serious about this role and was always fast at remembering her lines. During this period, her mother also wanted to be an actress.</p><p class=align-left>So the young actress was always trying to help her achieve the dream. Managing her career and her mother's made her even more exhausted.</p><h3>More film projects, anxiety and depression</h3><p class=align-left>From 1978, the actress was already busy with movies. Two years later, she landed a role as Angel Bright in Little Darlings, a theatrical film. She also did a voice-over in Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp animation fantasy film, playing the Princess's character.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6a0374a176a7e561.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Afton Smith: Brendan Fraser divorce story and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>By 1984, exhaustion was already taking a toll on the talented actress. She even declined travelling to Europe to shoot scenes for the movie Just the Way You Are. However, she travelled to Paris to work on a project by Edouard Molinaro. During this period, Kristy dropped weight due to depression and discomfort.</p><p class=align-left>Kristy went home for the Christmas break but refused to return even though the movie was to be completed in a year. She underwent psychological therapy, and it was here that the talented actress was <a href=# title="What happened to Kristy McNichol" rel="nofollow noopener">diagnosed </a>with physical and emotional exhaustion and severe depression.</p><h3>Reappearance in Empty Nest</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cd134c43c6ba9c4.jpg><p class=align-left>As expected of anyone in her position and status, rumours began spreading that Kristy's emotional state resulted from drug and alcohol abuse. To deny the negative individuals from digging deep into her personal life, she decided that she didn't want anything to do with acting again. Years passed by, and the actress underwent intensive treatment in silence.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5cc8b997dcd0b982.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Dr Emily Thomas and why did she leave Dr. Pol?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 1988, she made a comeback in Empty Nest as Barbara Weston.

She <a href=# title="What happened to Kristy McNichol" rel="nofollow noopener">announced </a>that she had been in the industry for long and now wanted to know what was there beyond acting.</p><h2>Where is Kristy McNichol now?</h2><p class=align-left>After years of recovery, Kristy started sharing her experiences to help other people struggling with depression. She also served as an acting teacher at a Los Angeles private institution.
