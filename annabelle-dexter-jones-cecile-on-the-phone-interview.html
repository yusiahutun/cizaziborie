For her directorial debut, Dexter-Jones wrote and directed Cecile on the Phone, an 11-minute short which explores the melodrama that ensues when a former flame reenters one's life. Cecile (played by Dexter-Jones herself) descends into hysteria while ruminating over her ex-boyfriend's return to New York through phone conversations with a colorful cast of characters. Below, Dexter-Jones opens up about her inspiration, the film's Sundance debut and what it's like to direct yourself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Harper's BAZAAR: What inspired the short film?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Annabelle Dexter-Jones: </strong>I wanted to make a film that was about obsession and this loss of perspective, and the ways in which we dilute ourselves and distract ourselves. I think a break-up story is something that everyone can easily relate to—at least [to] one person in the situation. I also wanted to talk about the ways in which we lose perspective, when we are lost in that moment and we really can’t see beyond ourselves, and to look at that and not punish ourselves for doing it but to have a sense of humor and absurdity of the situation. I love ‘70s cinema, I love horror, and it was a way to play with all the different things that I love. It's also about the contrast between what’s going on and what we try to put out to the world.</p><img alt="Face, Photograph, Child, Nose, Skin, Cheek, Head, Eyebrow, Lip, Eye, " title="Face, Photograph, Child, Nose, Skin, Cheek, Head, Eyebrow, Lip, Eye, " width=1000 height=638 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-cecile-2-1497999841.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: Which is so relevant today with the social media, and that makes it even more interesting, because she's having all these conversations over an old-fashioned phone with a cord.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ADJ: </strong>That was a question too. Does that seem effective? Does that seem contrived/over stylized? But it was important for me to have a landline because there is something so much more physically significant about it, something even human or sexual, like there is something that grounds her, almost like a leash or something. She is so attached to it. And you know, she is a New Yorker. She grew up in New York, she is the kind of person who would have a landline. I find that people who grew up in New York have landlines. She’s self-indulgent and the kind of person who would sit on the phone. She needs the landline because there is something Warholian in that kind of indulgence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: What was the inspiration for the look of the film?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ADJ: </strong>I love cinema, I love a lot of '70s cinema and I love Mike Nichols, one of my favorite movies that I discovered as I was making this movie was An Unmarried Woman with Jill Clayburgh. There are all sorts of references there; I'm sure there are many I'm not even conscious of.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: Tell me about debuting at Sundance. How did that feel?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ADJ: </strong>It was a huge honor to be accepted. I had never been before and I was really happy with the way it happened because I'm also an actor and it is really exciting to go with this, my own piece that I created. It’s like my baby. I learned from a lot of really talented experts <span></span>in the process of making this movie.<span></span> I couldn’t do it by myself. It was really exciting to see the other short films at Sundance because my experience with short films is that they are always struggling for a reason to exist. I see a lot that are a means to get something else made, but these films that I saw at the festival—I was pretty blown away. I was really excited to be considered in that group.</p><img alt="Lip, Hairstyle, Eyebrow, Eyelash, Jaw, Jewellery, Beauty, Blond, Chest, Drinking, " title="Lip, Hairstyle, Eyebrow, Eyelash, Jaw, Jewellery, Beauty, Blond, Chest, Drinking, " width=2000 height=1275 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-cecile-3-1497999888.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: What made you want to move into directing? Was it always something you planned to do? Or was it a natural progression from acting?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ADJ: </strong>I think it has always been a fantasy of mine and I have been writing since college. I write fiction and stories with the intention that one day I would put these things into a screenplay. It has always been a fantasy of mine and I was ready and I had the confidence to do it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Who are some of your favorite writers?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ADJ: </strong>Carson McCullers, <span class=redactor-unlink>Michel Houellebecq</span>... Right now, Mark Twain—his late stuff is so incredible and way out there. It's wildly ahead of its time and very controversial.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB: Was it weird to direct yourself?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ADJ: </strong>Yes.
