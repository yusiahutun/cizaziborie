Three years after the release of her Grammy-nominated sixth studio album, Positions, the “Thank U, Next” and “Into You” singer dropped her latest single, “Yes, And?” on Friday, Jan. 12. The key takeaway? It’s a certified bop, a celebratory banger destined to get blared across worldwide dance floors as early as tonight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Immediately following the release of the song and its accompanying music video, Grande fans began to speculate about the meaning behind the “Yes, And?” lyrics, theorizing its hyper-confident, self-love attitude is a direct response to haters still criticizing her relationship with her Wicked reboot co-star, Ethan Slater. That’s… a lot to digest, so let’s unpack it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the just-over-three-minute track, Grande adopts a cheeky, unbothered POV about the public scrutiny she's faced. The chorus emphasizes this message, with Grande coquettishly whispering, “Yes, and? / Say that shit with your chest, and / Be your own fuckin’ best friend / Say that shit with your chest / Keep moving like, ‘What’s next?’ ‘Yes, and?’”. Written by Grande, writer/producer Ilya Salmanzadeh (Beyoncé, Sam Smith, Ellie Goulding), and the legendary Max Martin (the brains behind “...Baby One More Time”), “Yes, And?” has the potential to become one of the greatest clap-back anthems of all time.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is Ariana Grande’s “Yes, And?” About Ethan Slater?</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But what does Grande have to clap back at, and why? As fans on X (formerly Twitter) theorize, “Yes, And?” could be Grande’s response to the online chatter around the ambiguous timing of her romance with Slater. In July 2022, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People confirmed Grande and her now-ex Dalton Gomez split</a>. Three days later, sources told People and Us Weekly Grande and Slater <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>“recently” began dating</a>. That same month, Slater filed for divorce from his ex-wife Lilly Jay, immediately generating tons of questions about whether Grande and Slater got close before separating from their respective partners (for context: filming for Wicked began in December 2022, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Grande has seemingly addressed the backlash</a> before today’s release).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the second verse of “Yes, And?,” Grande posits, “Now, I’m so done with caring / What you think, no, I won’t hide / Underneath your own projections / Or change my most authentic life.” Oop — say less, Ari! Grande is particularly good at releasing perfectly-timed songs that wink at her personal life and the tornado of rumors that chase it (see: “No Tears Left to Cry,” “Thank U, Next,” “Everyday”).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of “Yes, And?”’s intended meaning, the song is a dance-pop bop reminiscent of Madonna’s “Vogue” and Beyoncé’s “Break My Soul”—it's one of her most joyous, uplifting, and celebratory singles to date. Apple Music describes Positions as the “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>lighthearted and playful</a>” follow-up to the “contemplative and mournful” Thank U, Next. So if “Yes, And?” is any indication, Positions is set to be pure fun and quite possibly the end of Ariana's sad girl era for good.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The “Yes, And?” music video is a joyful nod to Paula Abdul’s 1988 classic “Cold Hearted,” in which Abdul rehearses for a group of critics. Grande’s version is a riotous hell of a good time flanked with updated critics joking about her signature high ponytail and her whereabouts (One says, “Who cares if she’s happy? I don’t want happy—I want art.”). Grande emerges with her fresh blonde ‘do, a cute hat reminiscent of Abdul’s, plus fabulous choreography that harkens back to New York City’s ‘80s and early-’90s LGBTQ+ ballroom culture. Her dancers—styled as concrete statues that melt into oblivion—pose meticulously to reference Grande’s previous album eras, which is her tasteful way of telling the world she’s evolved once more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Try not to smile while watching.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read the full lyrics below via <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Genius</a>.<br></p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>“Yes, And?” Lyrics</h3><p>In case you haven't noticed</p><p>Well, everybody's tired</p><p>And healin' from somebody</p><p>Or somethin' we don't see just right</p><p>Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (No one can tell you nothin')</p><p>Come on and walk this way through the fire (Don't care what's on their mind)</p><p>And if you find yourself in a dark situation</p><p>Just turn on your light and be like</p><p>"Yes, and?"</p><p>Say that shit with your chest, and</p><p>Be your own fuckin' best friend</p><p>Say that shit with your chest</p><p>Keep moving like, "What's next?"</p><p>"Yes, and?"</p><p>Now, I'm so done with caring</p><p>What you think, no, I won't hide</p><p>Underneath your own projections</p><p>Or change my most authentic life</p><p>Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (No one can tell you nothin')</p><p>Come on and walk this way through the fire (Don't care what's on their mind)</p><p>And if you find yourself in a dark situation</p><p>Just turn on your light and be like</p><p>"Yes, and?"</p><p>Say that shit with your chest, and</p><p>Be your own fuckin' best friend</p><p>Say that shit with your chest</p><p>Keep moving like, "What's next?"</p><p>"Yes, and?"
