As the Korean reality-TV show continues to gain popularity worldwide – it is the second most watched Netflix programme in Hong Kong – and more background information on each of the 12 contestants is being revealed after each episode, viewers cannot not but begin to wonder who exactly these hot-looking young men and women are."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

His eager pursuit of fellow contestant Song Ji-a is being viewed as gold-digger behaviour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He denied the host bar rumour on Weibo in both Korean and Chinese on January 3, saying he is definitely not a yazi (gigolo) and he has never done anything bad in his life. A Weibo user said: “It’s so hilarious!”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The Silent Sea: new Netflix K-drama the latest Korean sci-fi fail</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Song Ji-a</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Song, 25, graduated from Hanyang University, where she majored in traditional Korean dancing, and is now a beauty content creator. In the show, she has been asked out by three male contestants, which makes her, to date, the most popular woman on Single’s Inferno.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her maoxi (feline) style of make-up has become a beauty trend in China. She describes herself as “cute and sexy”, and her confident and classy personality has made #SongJia a trending topic on Twitter. One Twitter user said: “girls dont want a boyfriend, they just want song jia.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Kim Hyeon-joong</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kim is a 28-year-old fitness trainer and model. His sculpted body is getting a lot of attention. One Twitter user wrote: “Kim Hyeon-joong is hitting, he got the visual exactly!!” Kim, Choi and Song form a love triangle in the show.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Besides Choi, he also faces a threat from his friend Cha Hyun-seung, who also showed interest in Song.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/05/e342bb6b-394f-4405-ace3-ebf5cece74f0_53933fe2.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Shin Ji-yeon</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shin is 25 years old and studying neuroscience at the University of Toronto in Canada. Internet users are attracted by her because she has both looks and brains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/05/c1afe1d7-4eb1-49cc-b780-93105cffc4d9_cdc79fee.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Moon Se-hoon</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Moon’s age and occupation are still undisclosed because he has yet to score a date (the information is only released after contestants leave inferno for paradise, a luxury hotel, after they get paired off with another).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He keeps picking Shin, who continues to reject him. Even when two newcomers in episode five wanted a date with him, he continued to pick Shin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/05/846f6881-5aed-47e9-94e2-ee72eca2f477_53933fe2.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">On Jin-taek</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 30-year-old owner of a tailoring shop expressed interest in contestants Kang So-Yeon and Shin. He had his first date with Kang and told her, “You are the only one I wanna come here [to paradise] with”, but the following day dated Shin. His perceived betrayal made many internet users angry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One Twitter user said: “Jin-taek is getting on my ****ing nerves.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/05/ad3862f6-6b5e-4d8f-aa47-31472dfe913f_53933fe2.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Kang So-yeon</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kang, 34 years old and the owner of a boxing gym, is described as a da zuiba (someone who can’t keep others’ secrets) by a user on Bilibili, China’s answer to YouTube. She deliberately stirs up drama in the show.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For example, new contestant Cha Hyun-seung confides in Kang that he finds An Yea-Won funny and charming but asks her not to tell An. Kang then blabs this to An – in front of Song Ji-a, who Cha had invited for a date earlier that day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/05/c165874b-c37f-45c3-9bf9-b29775415e88_53933fe2.jpg><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">Kim Jun-sik and An Yea-won</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kim Jun-sik, the 28-year-old chief executive of a health products brand, and 27-year-old Pilates instructor and model An Yea-won paired up after both failed to find a partner in the first round of matching.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That seems to have worked since, compared with other contestants, they don’t cause much drama – although they did take a bath together during their date in “paradise”, which some considered shocking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/05/0929e769-2a8c-4b09-a907-ae8cebc941fd_2970b9f4.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Cha Hyun-seung, Seong Min-ji and Kim Su-min</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The trio just joined the show in episode five, so there are very few details about them. However, if you are familiar with Korean show business then you will recognise Cha as a K-pop singer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Single’s Inferno ends on January 8. The audience is expecting these new contestants will add more drama – and perhaps true romance – to the series’ finale.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZqRllKeurq2OmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkG9pa21jZLumwMWloLFlopqurbXTsmStrl2ZrrW1zaBkrKCfrHq0tc2go56rXZ67p7HRp6Zmm5%2Bjwaa%2F05qlras%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
