According to a press release, they'll "meet her high school friend and see the places she frequented before becoming famous."</p><p>The trip will also take them to Los Angeles, where the two will "visit several sentimental locations" and Dannielynn will see, "for the first time, some of Anna Nicole’s memorabilia from her life and career, tucked away in a storage locker following her death."</p><p>A preview clip from the special shows Larry digging into the storage locker and pulling out a number of items from Anna's past, including a wedding dress, old clothes she wore on dates with him and a photo album.</p><p>"Dannielynn has no idea that she's gonna see these things. All this is a surprise," says Larry in the footage. "She has a big heart like her mom had and I think she could appreciate these things."</p><p>"This is stuff that I had for you for like a long time," he says, as she reacts in shock.</p><p>"Anna should be remembered as this larger than life figure that was really a caring, giving person, a beautiful lady who loved her fans and loved her family," he adds in the footage.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>NEW: Anna Nicole Smith | What happens when her family goes in search of her secrets, past and possessions? ‘Tragic Beauty’ the new <a href=#>#ABC2020</a> event premieres Friday night at 9|8c on ABC. <a href=#>https://t.co/ZGewRPfd2o</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4UnUIvKlvv</a></p>— 20/20 (@ABC2020) <a href=#>January 30, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@ABC2020</a><p>A trailer for the special also shows one of Anna's childhood friends telling Dannielynn she looks "just like her" mom.</p><p>"Dannielynn's a teenager now and she doesn't really know a ton of things about her mom," Larry says in the footage. "As a dad who has a child whose mom passed away, I thought, why not travel back to Anna's beginnings. To be really honest, I didn't know a lot about Anna, her early years."</p><p>"To this day Howard has been supportive," Birkhead said. "Almost [as if] the same loyalty that he had for Anna has now carried over to me and Dannielynn."</p><p>"When you talk about Anna Nicole and you talk about where she came from ... you talk about the court battles," he also told ABC News. "In between, there were a lot of happy moments for her. There was a lot of highs before there was a lot of lows."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:95ebe0c9-47d6-5635-9a01-729b008fceef data-container-ref=toofab:article:fff35aa4-cd6d-4453-8046-bd36a44f885c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b5/5by4/2020/01/17/b54d065f40f75b3caf6522edd0eb7b19_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Lifetime/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">11 Anna Nicole Secrets from Larry Birkhead on Her Jealously, Baby Drama and Death</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>According to ABC, the special will also report on "the dichotomy between who Anna Nicole was in the spotlight and who she was in private as Vickie Lynn Smith, her rise to fame, life in the limelight, her tragic death in Florida and the unanswered questions about her death."</p><p>Anna Nicole passed away in 2007 at the age of 39 following an accidental drug overdose.
