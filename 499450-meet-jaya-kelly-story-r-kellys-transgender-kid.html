The news surprised many, including his father, who spoke against it <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">during an interview</a> in 2014. However, Jaya's mother showed support and publicly respected his child's decision.</p><p class=align-left>Jaya "Jaah" Kelly was born female in 2000 in the United States of America. He changed his gender in 2014 after announcing on a now-deleted <i>Askfm</i> video that he was a <a href=#>transgender male</a>.</p><h3>How old is Jaya Kelly?</h3><p class=align-left>He is 23 years old in 2023. Jaya's parents are Robert Sylvester Kelly, a famous musician/convicted s*x offender, and Andrea "Lee" Danyell, a choreographer and actress.

His siblings include Joann (born in 1998) and Robert Jr (born in 2002).</p><p class=align-left>Growing up, Jaah moved houses frequently with his family due to his father's profession.

Jaah revealed that he faced bullying at school as a result.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/313b8177a1be4075.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Natasha Udovenko?

An account linking to his music on SoundCloud going by the name <i>@Jaah.bby</i> is believed to belong to him. However, the account has remained dormant for a while and has only two posts. The celebrity's absence on <a href=#>social media</a> could be due to cyber-trolling after his father's legal troubles and sexual abuse convictions.</p><p class=align-left>Jaya Kelly is famous as the child of embattled singer and songwriter R Kelly.
