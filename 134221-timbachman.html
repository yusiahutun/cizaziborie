The original BTO lineup included Randy Bachman (guitar, lead vocals), Fred Turner (bass, vocals), Tim Bachman (guitar, vocals), and Robbie Bachman (drums).</p><p>Tim left the group in 1974 and was replaced by Blair Thornton on guitar. He returned in 1984 for a ten-year reunion tour and led touring versions of the band in the late 80s. He then began work as a realtor in the Abbotsford area and served as the Fraser Valley Real Estate Board Director from 2003 – 2008.
