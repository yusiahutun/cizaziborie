Another scene in the <a href=#>Christmas</a> flick saw Geraldine pass away, and did so shortly before the holidays.</p><p>On the scenes no longer being a part of the movie, Frances <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “We had a lovely scene. And I think it was the only gay scene. It’s odd that they cut it. Maybe it was too dark to bring into it.

Richard admitted when it came to comments made about his leading ladies’ bodies, such as <a href=#>Renée Zellweger</a> and Martine McCutcheon.</p><p>He said in the conversation with his daughter: “I think I was behind, you know, behind the curve, and those jokes aren’t any longer funny, so I don’t feel I was malicious at the time, but I think I was unobservant and not as, you know, as clever as I should have been.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Bradley Cooper’s strict rule on set as a director impacted the entire cast</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2d%2FcLTAq6myZaCkwbWx0WaqrZmiYsCixdJmm5qqm2LApLHNnqpmr5Wnsm6v1K1kn6qfonqnrcyorKxlk52%2Fqr%2FTppisZZ2kw6qxjKWmr51dlrC1wcClo7Jn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
