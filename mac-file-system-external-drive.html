It's likely formatted for Windows (using NTFS) or maximum compatibility (using FAT32). For a Mac user, neither of these file systems is desirable.</p><p>Open the <strong>Disk Utility</strong> app. In the left panel, you’ll see the listing of internal and external drives separately. Now choose <strong>View > Show All Devices</strong> to see the storage device at the top level, then the container, and finally any volumes in the container.</p><p>In the sidebar, select the external storage device. Be sure to choose the device, not the volume or volumes it contains. In the toolbar, click <strong>Erase</strong>. Type in the disk name you want, then select your preferred option for <strong>Format</strong> and <strong>Partition Scheme</strong>.

Let’s take a detailed look at each of them, what they’re used for, and which you should pick for your external drive.</p><h3 id=apple-file-system-apfs>Apple File System (APFS)</h3><p>APFS is Apple’s modern file system, first launched in early 2017 for iOS devices. The experimental support of APFS was first seen in macOS Sierra. In High Sierra, SSD boot drives were converted to APFS upon installation. As of macOS Mojave, fusion drives and HDDs were also upgraded to APFS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The current <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple File System documentation</a> highlights many improvements over HFS+. It makes common operations such as copying files and folders instantaneous. You can also manage free space on the drives efficiently copy-on-write metadata scheme to improve performance, thereby reducing chances of data corruption and increasing focus on encryption.</p><h3 id=when-to-use-apfs><img alt="Samsung Portable SSD T5 on a desk" height=840 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Samsung-Portable-SSD-T5-on-a-desk.jpg width=1680 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>When to Use APFS:</h3><ul><li>If speed and convenience are your top priorities and cost is not an issue. An external SSD gives you the best performance over APFS, provided you don’t need to use the drive with other pre-Sierra Macs.</li><li>Apple lets you format an external drive and choose APFS for Time Machine on macOS Big Sur. However, you won’t be asked for this option for the already formatted HFS+ disk.</li><li>Time Machine backups to APFS are impressive when compared to HFS+. It’s fast, consumes less space, which means more room for backups, has greater resistance to data corruption, and copies cloned or sparse files efficiently.</li><li>Time Machine volumes formatted as APFS will only work with Macs running Big Sur or later. If you connect that disk to Catalina, Time Machine won’t recognize it.</li><li>You can only access drives formatted with APFS on Windows through third-party apps. Here are some of the <a href=#>best apps that read-write APFS on Windows</a>.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=mac-os-extended-hfs>Mac OS Extended (HFS+)</h3><p>Mac OS Extended, also known as HFS+ (Hierarchical File System Plus), was the primary file system used for Mac system storage from 1998 until APFS launched in 2017. If you bought a Mac between those dates, it shipped with macOS (or OS X, as it was known) installed on an HFS+ volume.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Samsung-Portable-SSD-T5-on-a-desk.jpg><h3 id=when-to-use-hfs>When to Use HFS+:</h3><ul><li>If you have older Macs (pre–2016), particularly those too old to update to a recent version of macOS, choosing HFS+ will enable you to use your external drive with those machines.</li><li>For Time Machine backups, use MacOS Extended (Journaled) if it’s a mechanical hard drive or if you’re using macOS Catalina or earlier. Even if you’re using SSD as a Time Machine drive, it’s not compatible with APFS.</li><li>You can only access drives formatted with HFS+ on Windows through third-party apps. Manufacturers like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seagate</a> lets you read and write data interchangeably on Windows and Mac without formatting the external drive.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=extended-file-allocation-table-exfat>Extended File Allocation Table (exFAT)</h3><p>Microsoft designed this to provide <a href=#>similar compatibility to FAT32 without the pesky limitations</a>. exFAT is the preferred file format for flash storage drives that you share between Windows and Mac. exFAT has no realistic file or partition size limits. It also doesn't require complicated ACLs and file attribution systems like NTFS.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/write_external_drive.jpg><h3 id=when-to-use-exfat>When to Use exFAT:</h3><ul><li>Both Mac and Windows offer full read and write support for exFAT. It's the ideal format if you frequently share files between your Windows-using friends and family.</li><li>As highlighted from this file system functionality comparison from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a>, exFAT does not support journaling, nor does it have built-in encryption. You may lose data in the event of a crash.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=ms-dos-fat>MS-DOS (FAT)</h3><p>Apple also includes support for FAT32, labeled as <strong>MS-DOS (FAT)</strong> in Disk Utility. You should generally avoid using FAT32 unless you’re dealing with an old computer or device.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fastest-usb-flash-drive-corsair-flash-voyager-gtx.jpg><p><strong>When to Use MS-DOS (FAT)</strong>:</p><ul><li>Flash drives you purchase will often come formatted with FAT32 for maximum compatibility with old computers (likely running Windows XP) and games consoles.</li><li>Individual files on a FAT32 drive can’t be over 4GB in size. Also, the partition must not exceed 8TB. exFAT is almost always a better choice.</li></ul><h2 id=should-you-convert-an-existing-external-drive-from-hfs-to-apfs>Should You Convert An Existing External Drive from HFS+ to APFS?</h2><p>If you’re still using HFS+ for external drives, switching to APFS is an easy task. Open <strong>Disk Utility</strong>, then click <strong>View > Show All Devices</strong> to view information about the disk and its volumes. Now right-click the volume in the sidebar, and select <strong>Convert to APFS</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windows-xp-splash-screen.jpg><p>But before you convert from HFS+ to APFS, consider the following factors:</p><ul><li>Do you want to use the external drive for data archival or backups? And do you want to use the same drive on other Macs, then note the macOS version and model.</li></ul><ul><li>Do you want to use the external drive to share with a Windows PC or Linux?</li></ul><ul><li>Are you using External Hard Drive or SSD?</li></ul><ul><li>Do you have a preference for certain backup apps or use Time Machine?</li></ul><p>If your sole purpose is to archive the data, you don’t need APFS. The whole outcome changes when you’re doing versioned backups. They generally include many different versions of the data, even copies of those files that have been deleted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>APFS, as we know, is an attractive option because it uses storage space more efficiently. You’ll be able to store far more backups in less time and space.</p><p>When your backup mode is via an external hard disk, you can go with APFS if performance is less critical than storage efficiency. But if performance and compatibility matter to you, stay with HFS+. APFS is always a preferred option for SSD if you want speed, better storage space management, and error-free backups. See our <a href=#>recommendations for the best external SSDs for Mac</a>.</p><h2 id=support-for-ntfs-drives>Support for NTFS Drives</h2><p>NTFS, which replaced FAT32 with the arrival of Windows XP, is still the dominant Windows file system. FAT32 had many severe limitations, including a maximum file size of 4GB and partition size of 8TB. This makes it unsuitable for most modern purposes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>macOS can read NTFS file systems natively, but it cannot write to them. You should use a third-party utility like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paragon NTFS for Mac</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tuxera NTFS for Mac</a> to enable write access. These utilities have been tested thoroughly and allow you to write to your existing NTFS volumes and format new drives to NTFS.</p><h2 id=using-an-external-hard-drive-for-time-machine-backups>Using an External Hard Drive for Time Machine Backups</h2><p>Ideally, the best file format is the one that covers your needs across all the platforms you use. For the best Time Machine compatibility, reformat your device with the GUID partition map scheme and HFS+ or APFS file format.</p><p>The release of Big Sur with APFS compatibility for external drives will change how we store or take backups. And as SSDs have become cheaper, we recommend using one of them for Time Machine and data backups.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9foq6kecWio55lo67AtbHMZpyxrJWnu6K4jJ2poq6VZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
