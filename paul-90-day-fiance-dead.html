The couple met online after he decided to look for love outside of his native Kentucky. “I haven’t had the best of luck in past relationships here locally,” he explained on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days</a>. “I’ve been betrayed. I’ve experienced unfaithful girlfriends — a lot of negative, chaotic things.

The pair tied the knot in Brazil in November 2017 and welcomed son Pierre in March 2019. “I’m very happy, very excited,” Paul told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a> at the time. “I’m also very nervous and want to do everything the best that I can and do everything right.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, help is available.

Anyone can make a baby, but going through the day-to-day process of being a father is going to be a new experience. I’m very happy, very honored and very privileged and I want to make sure I do my absolute best for Pierre.” They had a second son named Ethan in February 2021 once their first child turned almost two years old.&nbsp;Now, his family is concerned he’s gone missing in the Amazon. Here’s what we know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=is-paul-staehle-from-90-day-fiance-still-missing>Is <a href=# id=auto-tag_paul-staehle data-tag=paul-staehle>Paul Staehle</a> from 90 Day Fiancé still missing?</h2><p>Is Paul Staehle from 90 Day Fiancé still missing? Well, his location is still unknown but he is apparently alive. Blogger John Yates confirmed that the reality TV star is surviving in “a small indigenous community” and has been in contact with his family, per a voicemail shared to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>John’s Instagram</a> on September 3, 2023.</p><p>“Hey John, it’s Paul. In a small indigenous community. My signal is insanely bad,” the voicemail said. “And hopefully you’ll be able to get through to me.” The blogger wrote a note in his caption saying, “As I just discussed on my channel I have heard from Paul.”&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to this confirmation that Paul is alive, his wife Karine, who was in the United States when he went missing, nor his mother Edna had heard from him since August 31, 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/paul-karine-90-day-fiance-human-trafficking.jpeg><p>On Thursday, Karine shared an emotional reel of photos featuring Paul and their children with a caption cryptically written in the past tense: “💔 Not all of our memories were bad. Our children loved you very much. We will never forget you or the good memories we all shared,” which understandably led some fans to believe that he’d died. She clarified in her Story, “Paul went missing last night in Brazil. Prayers he is found safe.”</p><p>She explained further: “hello everyone I can’t give much information because we don’t have anything concrete to tell we are looking to find out where Paul is,” she began, adding that they have to “wait a certain amount of time” before contacting police. “this is not a joke,” she continued. “I was lost until messages arrived telling me everything.”</p><p>Paul’s mom Edna told <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a> that he’d been traveling in Brazil since the end of July, but had sent some worrying texts. “We’re told Paul told his mom he needed her help and was lost in the South American country, telling her needed a boat and giving her contact info for a few folks he said might be able to help him get out of his situation,” the site reported. “Edna says Paul has since gone radio silent … she can’t get in contact with him and it appears his phone is off, lost signal or is out of battery.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=paul-staehle-s-texts>Paul Staehle’s texts</h2><p>A friend shared screenshots of the text messages <a href=# rel=nofollow>to Instagram</a> with Edna’s permission. They are as follows—after he shared his location showing him in the middle of the Amazon jungle in Brazil.</p><p>Paul: I got lost<br>Edna: Who are you with and how did you get lost<br>Paul: I f—ked up i fugkrd up bad [sic]<br>Edna: You seem to not be being as careful and cautious as before. How? Can Izzy or Aunt help you? How did you F up? Who are you with?<br>Paul: Contact them I need help<br>Edna: Who? And why don’t you???<br>Paul: I am trying to<br>Edna: You need to NOW<br>Paul: I need a boat to get back<br>Edna: They can’t get you a boat and why would you go there alone that was very stupid<br>Paul: Mom my phone will die My gps will go awayv [sic]<br>Edna: Call them now!!!<br>Paul: You Please<br>Edna: Who are you with?<br>Paul: Alone<br>Edna: Sorry I messaged you , bad timing again …<br>Paul: Call them i need a boat [location sharing ended]<br>Edna: Tried all those names, no answer, left messages.</p><p>From the screenshots, you can see Edna tried calling her son several times and her increasingly panicked text messages proceeded to go unanswered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/90-day-fiance-fame-paul-staehle-claims-wife-karine-staehle-didnt-file-restraining-order-someone-else-did001.jpeg><p>It’s the second time Paul has gone missing. In July 2022, he and his son Pierre were reported missing for a week before safely returning home to Kentucky. He denied kidnapping his own child, insisting they had been on a long work trip together since early June.</p><p>Paul and Karine lost custody of their children to CPS after videos surfaced of the couple’s abusive relationship dating back to 2010 and Paul’s parents sought full custody of the kids. The couple split at the same time the video leaked but announced they were back together in April 2023.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Karine</a>&nbsp;could be pregnant again if her Instagram Stories are to be believed, as shortly after she posted about her missing husband, she appeared to be cradling a baby bump but it’s unclear if the photos are recent or throwbacks.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, help is available.
