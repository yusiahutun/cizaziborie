The top runway models who walk her shows, like Gigi Hadid, often look bare-faced, save for a little grooming here and there. Marant herself prefers a classic French Girl approach to beauty—contouring, baking, and cut creases are not in her repertoire. So it's a little bit of a shock to learn that Marant is collaborating with L'Oréal Paris on a new makeup line launching during fashion week this fall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’ve always interpreted fashion’s ready-to-wear literally, and I couldn’t be more thrilled at this chance to do that in makeup with an on-the-go collection with L’Oréal Paris,” the designer says in a press release. “It has been a dream to get right inside makeup innovation and to offer this collection of day-into-night, natural-to-smoking makeup essentials I have always wanted.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The collection will drop on September 27th, the day of Marant's next show, and consist of five "edgy yet practical" everyday makeup products for eyes, cheeks, and lips. No word yet on what the shades or formulas will be—but the prices will likely be super-affordable given it's a drugstore brand. We'll update this post when we know more.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"This is a collaboration that’s really of the moment: synonymous with Parisian elegance, Isabel Marant is one of the great self-made designers today. Absolutely true to herself and her independence, she’s the perfect partner for the brand, in our drive to make every woman around the world feel worth it,” Pierre-Emmanuel Angeloglou, L’Oréal Paris Global Brand President, says in the release.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Marant started her eponymous French bohemian brand in 1994. Known for her must-have booties, accessories, and wardrobe staples like chunky sweaters and moto-inspired jackets and jeans, Marant can now add makeup to her list of products that are sure to sell out.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqaZm5rCsXvAa2huamZmfnR7yKyYm52cYrqivsCnq2alkaCytryMpaarnZGherGt0aKqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
