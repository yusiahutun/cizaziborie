I've had two hip replacements and countless sprains. The worst years were in the 1980s, when I was getting severe back pain and no one was able to help me. I saw doctors, acupuncturists and therapists because my back was misaligned and the joint in my hip started to wear. Finally, I found a chiropractor who was able to help me.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I was born in Minnesota [in the US] and my family later moved to Vermont. Ever since I was five, when I saw my older sister take ballet lessons, I knew it was what I wanted to do. My parents moved to New York for me to study at the School of American Ballet. At the age of 16, when I was in the corps de ballet at the New York City Ballet, I became a soloist, then a principal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I've been with the New York City Ballet since 1964, making me the longest-serving female member. I've also lived in the same apartment block since 1975, just a few streets down from the Lincoln Centre, where the company is located. For over 30 years, I've walked from my apartment block down to the Lincoln Centre. I relish that sense of discipline. I like the fact that, as a dancer, you have to have discipline. I am now semi-retired and I work as a rehearser for The George Balanchine Foundation. I train the principal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of my key roles in the company is to work with dancers on works by [choreographer] George Balanchine. As one of the few people who worked with Balanchine when he was alive, I am able to bring that spirit forward to the dancers, therefore my day really depends on the performance schedule. There are times when I stay at the company straight through the day, starting at noon, rehearsing, and then staying for the performance. Other days I may not have to go in to the office at all.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I met Balanchine when I was 16. I was in The Nutcracker ballet, part of the candy-cane section. He came out to teach us. People think of him as the one of the greatest choreographers and such a magnetic person.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was a quiet gentleman, very detail-oriented but never, ever condescending to the young ones. He'd partner with us and show us the steps. The biggest discovery I made about dancing is that learning the technique is not just learning the alphabets, but it's using those alphabets to create words and sentences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Balanchine's works are often not strong in narrative but his steps are always surprising. Sometimes he'd make me jump several steps en pointe. They are small things, but they make such a difference. When I perform a work by Balanchine it always allows my emotion to get involved. Whether I am having a good day or not, the feelings connect to the ballet. It's very different from traditional choreography, where so much emphasis is placed on techniques.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I quickly became one of the few dancers Balanchine paid close attention to. It wasn't always easy - if there was a difficult step, he would say, 'Why don't you show the others how it's done?' I went from the corps de ballet to principal by the time I turned 18 and Balanchine created ballets for me. As much as I admired him, there was always a bit of distance in our relationship because I was in awe of him. He loved to talk about politics and religion and I was always afraid to talk because I didn't feel I was smart enough.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Back then, the New York City Ballet was a competitive place. It wasn't open, hostile competition but I was one of several dancers who really went after the best parts. When Balanchine died, at the age of 83, it was a very upsetting time for the ballet company because he had really changed the way of danced. I wanted to continue what he started.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the company is closed for the summer, I travel, as I am doing now, to work with companies like the Hong Kong Ballet as a guest instructor. Other times, my husband and I fly to Hawaii or Florida.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I don't tend to watch a lot of ballet performances - not that there isn't talent around. I like particular members of the American Ballet Theatre, the Kirov (Mariinsky), the Bolshoi and the Boston Ballet. It's funny because having been a professional dancer for so many years, it's actually my husband, whom I married in the 70s , who taught me a very important lesson.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He'd come see me perform a lot and one night we were on a date and we went dancing. He told me that when I am on stage, I am a lot stiffer and more emotionless than I am when I am on the dancefloor. It was something I hadn't noticed at all. I took his advice, naturally.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I've been married for more than 30 years. My husband is now retired from the United Nations, where</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">he served as a simultaneous translator. He speaks several languages, including Chinese, so when I am in Hong Kong I can use a few words I learned from him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Surprisingly for a dancer, I don't really control what I eat. I enjoy taking lunch in the neighbourhood, where I get a sandwich, a salad or even a burger. I confess I am not much of a cook. But the great thing about New York city is there are always great restaurants around. We</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">tend to go to bed quite early, at around 10pm, unless I have to be at a ballet show.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I've been very lucky in my life to be doing this for so long. I don't have children so it's really allowed me to focus. Even though I am still nursing some parts of my body every day and it's become pretty fragile and injured, there's nothing else I'd rather do.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdla4N5hZFopJ6qop65rXnArJ%2Blnak%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
