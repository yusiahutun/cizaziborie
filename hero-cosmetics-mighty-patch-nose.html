One might say that pulling off a plastic film from a new phone is the most satisfying thing ever. Others might say it’s dipping into a completely untouched jar of peanut butter. But if you’re a skincare junkie like us, there’s no greater feeling than taking off pimple patches and pore strips to see what they soaked up overnight."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

As you’ve likely already figured out, it’s a </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><i><span>hydrocolloid</span></i><span> nose patch</span></a><span>. We’ve been waiting for something like this forever—after all, your nose has tons of <a href=# id=auto-tag_pores data-tag=pores>pores</a> that get congested and form those impossible-to-remove blackheads.</span></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p><span>When your pores are having a bad day and are looking more noticeable than usual, the <a data-pmc-sp-product=ecc4d70d4ec0d44e32856d9611008f02 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Mighty Patch Nose","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Mighty Patch\u2122 Nose Patch from Hero Cosmetics - XL Hydrocolloid Pimples, Zits and Oil - Dermatologist-Approved Overnight Pore Strips to Absorb Acne Nose Gunk (10 Count)","price":"16.55","id":"B09NNF2DXX","category":"Pore Cleansing Strips"},"id":1247393,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Mighty Patch Nose</a> </span><span>can easily draw out all the gunk from your pores, as seen in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@itsdaraj</a>‘s TikTok, which has garnered over 366,000 views.</span><span> Simply put it on at night and peel the patch off the next morning to admire (or shudder at, depending on your threshold for gross things) the fabulous work it did, all while you were sound asleep. The TikToker says, “That is revolting in the best way possible,” as she pulls the patch off after wearing it overnight. Even without her removing it from her nose, viewers can see all of the white spots (a.k.a. the gunk) on the strip. Again, gross, but also super impressive.</span></p><p><span>And if you’re worried about the patch irritating your skin like other pore strips might, stress no more. It’s made of 100 percent medical-grade hydrocolloid, which is drug-free, non-drying and compatible with sensitive skin.

The patch is thin and flexible, so it won’t feel like you’re wearing anything on your nose. The extra-large size allows it to cover a whole lot of territory and also fit across different-sized noses with ease. It molds to your nose’s shape and doesn’t hurt or irritate upon removal. In fact, Hero Cosmetics doesn’t use any adhesives.</span></p><p><span>Whether you’re already a big fan of the brand’s iconic </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Mighty Patch</span></a><span> or you simply want to clean up your nose pores, <a data-pmc-sp-product=5a8198a7e71a1b1f0a7a8b39b7e88860 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Mighty Patch Nose","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Mighty Patch\u2122 Nose Patch from Hero Cosmetics - XL Hydrocolloid Pimples, Zits and Oil - Dermatologist-Approved Overnight Pore Strips to Absorb Acne Nose Gunk (10 Count)","price":"16.55","id":"B09NNF2DXX","category":"Pore Cleansing Strips"},"id":1247393,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Mighty Patch Nose</a> is on it.</span></p><p>“I have been using these strips on my chin once or twice a month since the last update and I have to say that my skin looks the best it ever has,” wrote one reviewer. “Once this product clears your skin, it keeps it that way!!”</p><p><span>Even those who have blackheads out of the wazoo praise <a data-pmc-sp-product=2a9400d978f8c0d753f9628ce4116773 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"this hero product","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Mighty Patch\u2122 Nose Patch from Hero Cosmetics - XL Hydrocolloid Pimples, Zits and Oil - Dermatologist-Approved Overnight Pore Strips to Absorb Acne Nose Gunk (10 Count)","price":"16.55","id":"B09NNF2DXX","category":"Pore Cleansing Strips"},"id":1247393,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>this hero product</a> .&nbsp;</span></p><p>“My nose had all [these] tiny blackhead dots [and] I was feeling pretty insecure about it.
