The company partnered with multiple stellar Korean beauty brands to stock their skincare, haircare and color cosmetics, and it’s often the brands’ sole storefront in the US.

Almost every best-selling products costs less than $10.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/peach-and-lily-mask.jpg><p>A playground for skincare junkies, Peach & Lily is your go-to for highly vetted K-beauty products, including its <a href=# rel=noopener>own namesake brand</a>. Founded by Alicia Yoon, a Harvard Business grad who went from beauty enthusiast to skincare expert, she fills the digital shelves of Peach & Lily with products she’s tried herself and sourced from her many trips to South Korea.

The best part of this store? Not only is shipping incredibly fast, but it always seems to be having a sale, offering up to 40 percent off the products you already wanted to try (hint: we suggest the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">cult BB creams</a>).

Previously, you couldn’t find their full range of products unless you visited one of their shops in Manhattan or Los Angeles — but now it has a fully-stocked online store. Now you can buy your Panda hand creams and Bunny face misters at midnight and have them in the amount of time it takes to ship from NYC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cosrx-acne-pimple-master-patch-5-set.png><p>This tiny boutique in Chinatown, NYC, is pretty much the gateway to all the new <a href=# rel=noopener>K-beauty products</a>.
