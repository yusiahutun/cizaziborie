Digital nomads like Clarke have become a new target market in Indonesia’s plans to revive its pandemic-hit, US$63 billion tourism sector. To prop up Bali’s status as a digital nomad hub, Southeast Asia’s biggest economy plans to introduce a new type of long-term visa, which lasts for five years and will enable foreigners to live and work in the country without a work permit."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Last year, only around a million international tourists visited the island, a 83.26 per cent decline year on year, according to government statistics. <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">China</span></a> was the biggest source of inbound arrivals, followed by <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">India</span></a>, Russia, and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Japan</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bali has for decades been Indonesia’s top tourist destination, thanks to its unique Hindu culture and impressive natural landscape, but in recent years its strength as a digital nomad hub has increased as technology advances and internet speeds improve. Places like the lush jungles of Ubud or surf heaven Canggu are now not only tourist hotspots, but second homes to creative types like cinematographer Mario Gonzalez Diaz.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/03/23/7f6f8679-1083-44d1-995c-64a64ffb13ee_ee237844.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There were a lot of events before the coronavirus pandemic, so it was super, super easy to meet people. It’s crazy how many different, cool people are around. Not only [those who work] in cinematography, but in other aspects in life, like yoga. A lot of people are doing meditation, a lot of people are really finding different ways of living here in Ubud,” Diaz said.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If the digital nomad visa goes ahead it will make Indonesia even more attractive to this set of workers, putting the country on par with places such as Georgia and Estonia, which already offer the visas. Their presence, in turn, can boost various sectors of the economy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Foreign work visas in Indonesia are [at present] very complicated and expensive, I think this has discouraged digital nomads from moving to Indonesia and encouraged many others to live in Indonesia off the grid,” said Matt Gebbie, director at hospitality consultant Horwath HTL in Indonesia.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I encourage the reduction in visa red-tape and an increase in digital nomads living and working in Bali. With [the nomadic] lifestyle there is income to be earned from flights, boats, cars, hotels, cafes, attractions and entertainment. Digital nomads love adventure and will explore, sharing the joy of the income they earn with the local population.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/03/23/787ca6be-89f9-45f2-b813-b162cb2aef4f_00a86591.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Southeast Asia, Bali will have to compete with Thailand’s Chiang Mai or Koh Phangan, Malaysia’s Penang, Vietnam’s Da Nang, Hoi An, or Ho Chi Minh City, and Davao in the Philippines, all of which have also enjoyed a surge of digital nomad visitors in recent years. Thailand’s Board of Investment in December proposed a change to its Smart Visa requirements so that digital nomads and remote workers could stay in the country for up to four years.&nbsp;</p>Advocates of the new type of visa say it could help to curb illegal practices. At present, there are many people working in the country who are thought to be doing so illegally, under tourist visas, while others have been paying bribes, through third party services, for visa extensions. In January, an American self-described digital nomad <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Kristen Gray</span></a> was deported from Indonesia after being accused of visa violations and tax avoidance in relation to her Bali-based graphic design business.&nbsp;<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Diaz, the cinematographer in Ubud, had a tip for foreigners hoping to work in Bali on how to avoid a fate similar to that of Gray.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Philippine beach resorts target local long-stay tourists, digital nomads</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think it’s a matter of respect, for local people and local rules. There are some foreigners in Bali and they don’t want to have relationships with Balinese people, I see that happening a lot. If you don’t care about Balinese people, then Balinese people won’t like you.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think foreigners should also at least give something back to Balinese people as during the coronavirus pandemic, many local people are struggling to get decent pay.”&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clarke, the cryptocurrency investor, said the success of the new visa would hinge in part on what tax arrangements Jakarta decided on.<br>He urged Jakarta to consider making it easier for online entrepreneurs to set up in the country so it could compete with Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think the new visa is a great first step, and I think most people would be willing to pay tax as well, for example a flat rate of 10 per cent income tax. This would bring the Indonesian economy out of the dark a little bit and into the light, and boost the tax coffers of Bali and Indonesia,” Clarke said.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If Bali gets the regulation right here, it can really put itself on the map as a new tech hub in the region.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLKku82opKKbo2Sus8DInKOeZ2Nmf3eCl3FmsKeioHqjrcuiZJudkZi1brXNnaannaOerm68y5qlrGWUnrSqwMClZKennZaxbsLIrJhmmp%2BkwLV5yK2q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
