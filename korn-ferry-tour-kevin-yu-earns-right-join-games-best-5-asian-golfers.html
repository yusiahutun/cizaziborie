The Taiwanese professional became just the second golfer from the self-ruled island to secure a PGA Tour card through the second-tier competition, and helped set a record in the process as one of five Asian golfers to earn spots on the elite circuit.
It was the perfect birthday gift for Yu, who turned 23 last week."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Despite missing the halfway cut, he finished in 20th position on the points list to join China’s Carl Yuan and Marty Dou Zecheng, and Korean duo Byeong Hun An and Seonghyeon Kim among the Top-25 who move on to play against the likes of Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Will Zalatoris.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s amazing, it’s a dream come true to me,” Yu said. “I’ve been dreaming of this moment since I was five years old and since I just started to play golf. Now it’s a dream come true and I’m looking forward to next season.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is the first time a total of five Asian golfers have emerged from the Korn Ferry Tour’s regular season graduating class.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yuan concluded his campaign as No 1 and the Dalian native is now looking forward to his first stint on the main tour. He is the third mainland Chinese golfer after Dou and Xinjun Zhang, both in 2018, to hold a Tour card.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/15/ba0e3f7f-532b-4903-b4d3-108ddf857b73_5a1f8a31.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s going to be a new experience,” Yuan said. “New courses, new challenges … maybe pair up with some big names, learn from them.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He is under no illusion the road ahead will be challenging. Becoming the first mainland Chinese winner on the PGA Tour and breaking into the world’s top-30 are some of his long-term goals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I hope I could have a PGA Tour title within five years, and be in world top-30 too,” Yuan said. “Many objectives are waiting for me. The PGA Tour is a new platform, and I may need some time to get adapted. The golf courses will be more difficult and I may find a caddie who is more familiar with Tour courses. I think I have an advantage on the long game, but I need to improve my short game.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dou is getting a second crack at the big leagues, and said he felt better prepared this time than he was four years ago.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It feels real now,” he said. “The first year I got there, I kind of felt I wasn’t ready. But it’s been three years now from that time, and I do feel like all parts of my game are set for the big Tour.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1moKecm3yivtOimqWdX2h%2BeYSXcnBoo5%2Bnu26yxKupsmWkpMKzecqeraKmXa7CbrHAq6WsZaKetKnAjKOmoqZdnK6usdJmmZ6rpGKCbq3SopinZZekuaex0aw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
