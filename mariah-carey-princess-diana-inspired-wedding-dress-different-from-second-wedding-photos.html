For her special day, she turned to renowned bridal gown designer, <a class=hm-link href=#>Vera Wang</a>, and walked down the aisle in a $25,000 dress that boasted a 27-foot train and a 10-foot veil.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eou6BJhnyMh data-wc=32>According to Vera, Mariah "was very moved and influenced" by <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Diana's 1981 royal wedding</a> to then-Prince Charles'. "It was very much like Diana at Westminster Abbey," she previously told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=eEU5NfCwWVx data-wc=38><strong>"She wanted that level of pomp and circumstance and romance and volume,"</strong> Vera added. "She really wanted a princess look, and it was just one of those weddings that was truly a fairytale in the sense of scale."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f9da8ee192b1-princess-diana-wedding-dress.jpg><p id=e-vxePXW7b data-wc=43>The similarities between Mariah's and Diana's dresses are evident. Not only did they both have floor-sweeping veils – the late princess had a 25-foot veil – but Mariah also wore a tiara and carried a large bouquet of white flowers with green leaves.&nbsp;</p><p id=eAI24XZWtJ data-wc=22>Mariah's gown also featured a bodice with pear detailing, puffed sleeves, and a voluminous full skirt that flared out at the waist.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cf0d22c4eb7a-mariah-carey-vera-wang-wedding-dress.jpg><p id=ezgGA1TSQV data-wc=39>That wasn't the only time Mariah rocked her unforgettable wedding dress. In 2005 she slipped it back on for her 'We Belong Together' music video – and if she had her way, she would have set it on fire!&nbsp;</p><p id=eV48RLMIrb7 data-wc=29>"When I did 'We Belong Together' I was going to burn the wedding dress," she said on 'Watch What Happens Live' in 2018. "That was my original wedding dress."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/041a7d46cc9c-mariah-carey-wedding-dress-we-belong-together-music-video.jpg><p id=et8dPqaxcKe data-wc=34>However, Mariah didn't get her wish as the video's director rejected the idea. <strong>"I wanted to burn it at the end of the video,"</strong> she added. <strong>"I thought it would've been dramatic, nobody understood."&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Wedding dress number two&nbsp;</h2><p id=e30g8Hx6tzf data-wc=26>For her 2008 wedding to Nick Cannon at her Bahamian estate, Mariah opted for a drastically different look, choosing a "simple" slip dress by Nile Cmylo.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLjYgmT186 data-wc=35><strong>"It was a simple, slim-cut dress in an off-white that turns into a very pale pink to match the sand. And [Christian] Louboutins,"</strong> she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People&nbsp;</a>when asked about the dress shortly after the wedding.&nbsp;</p><p id=epnFkBo_h3l data-wc=53>However, the designer was forced to make some last-minute alterations on the morning of the wedding after he discovered Mariah would be wearing the dress for their beach ceremony, and not in a music video, which is the ruse she told her intimate group of guests to keep her wedding day a secret.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHn7Ekwyvc data-wc=40>"I was pulled aside and said this is actually a real wedding," Nile told Access Hollywood. "So, I went back to the fabric store in the morning and started over again and came back with something a little more appropriate."</p><p id=e0-l7PckkCx data-wc=31><strong>Get the lowdown on the biggest, hottest celebrity news, features and profiles coming out of the U.S. <a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our HELLO!
