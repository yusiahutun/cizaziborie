For gold and silver pieces that means that the color and plating look as realistic as possible versus being too pale or yellow” says Diana Tsui, celebrity fashion stylist. The key is to have fun with it, and remove the stress and commitment of purchasing long lasting expensive pieces.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Below are some of my own favorite affordable jewelry brands, each with their own unique styles to shop from.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mejuri></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mejuri Organic Pearl Hoops" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/66dzhdK4uYvcUlNQ_z6ZxhGKUn8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mejuri-organic-pearl-hoops-505298c2f8634cae8260da5b6c9606aa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mejuri</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone active on social media has probably come across Mejuri a handful of times. But they’re more than just a good marketing campaign. Stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Diana Tsui</a> particularly loves their<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"> chunky dome huggies</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">sculptural silver waves</a> as “more wearable, everyday version of the giant Bottega earrings that we’re seeing all over social media”. But I find the wide range of styles the most appealing. You can find something from this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>celebrity-approved brand</a> for every style and occasion, with each product category having over a 100 design options with most pieces under $150</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ana-luisa></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Ap3QSMFoqPqlqFGFAiB5Y_OdRG8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ana-luisa-5a0b1c9f1d854bd5bf5179da0609d11d.jpg"><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As the brand that I turn to when I want to venture out of my comfort zone, Ana Luisa offers more playful, youthful pieces made from the same gold-plated silver materials that most of these affordable jewelry brands use. Some of their everyday pieces retail for less than $30, removing much of the intense decision making process of selecting jewelry —&nbsp;yes, you can get the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">pearl drop earrings</a> and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">letter necklace.</a> You can buy it, wear it for a few months, and move onto the next style without any bad feelings. Not only because the purchase didn’t cost your wallet, but because their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">extensive sustainability practices</a> don’t cost the planet much harm either.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gorjana></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gorjana Diamond Bee Necklace" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uo3h9gr-rA2ZjOYJt5LtlY5emkY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gorjana-diamond-bee-necklace-f9f4ca5da9bc49ab9ef5d6785a062e0a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gorjana</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gorjana makes layering jewelry easy. Over the last 18 years since their launch, the husband-and-wife founded brand steadily rose to fame by making attainable and sleek accessories. Despite being delicate and simple, their designs stray from the same old looks you see everywhere else. Take the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">rope necklace with a clasp charm</a>, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">checkered bar bracelet</a>, or a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">statement band ring</a> for example —&nbsp;each offers a unique touch to an otherwise common piece. The best part?

Now, much like other revived Y2K trends, Alex & Ani is making a comeback with their meaningful and sentimental jewelry pieces. While they still carry their iconic <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">charm bracelets</a>, you’ll find plenty of playful <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">necklaces</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">earrings</a> as well. Their designs take a youthful approach to jewelry, offering colorful gems, butterfly charms, and heartwarming messages engraved into clean recycled metals.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-madewell></span> <img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell Bracelet" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YXuOMFiS-qjZ91sjI7uvgt-Gixw=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-simple-cuff-bracele-1607203a8f1f4658ad1262ef4e90b4c8.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’re probably familiar with Madewell’s quality clothing, but have you ever browsed through their extensive collection of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">everyday jewelry</a>? They have both minimalist pieces, as well as subtly quirky charms, all of which are elevated with quality designs and materials. Most of their offerings are gold-plated over brass, but last a surprisingly long time. I personally buy my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">hoops</a> from Madewell, and the ones I got in 2020 still look quite good in 2023, despite my wearing them in the shower, beach, and sleep all the same.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aurate></span> <img width=1500 height=1200 data-sizes=750px alt="Gold Rope Chain Necklace" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kzEZPihv9fG8Ecan_lQiuo64VFE=/fit-in/1500x1200/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/AU-5_64d12694-949b-40ad-b6b9-60cdb5b8709c_1200x-a2dfd9c564254e5eae0d29babdaaea39.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Aurate</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s difficult to find jewelry that’s beautiful, made of quality materials, crafted sustainably, and doesn’t come with a shocking price tag… or at least it used to be. Now Aurate, which is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>backed by Kerry Washington,</a> offers just that. By using recycled luxurious materials, operating locally, and producing on a made-to-order basis so nothing gets wasted, they can bring forth elevated designs with ever-lasting materials at an affordable price. It’s important to set expectations right, however. Their pieces are affordable in comparison to what the market standard is for the same design and material. So, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">diamond earring</a> that typically retails for over $1,000, can be purchased at $250 here.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-baublebar></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BaubleBar Mickey Mouse Disney Tennis Bracelet" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QnfMj3_Yzxa8-dSuuQmgeM2kBe8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/baublebar-mickey-mouse-disney-tennis-bracelet-7d625432f697495cbb929d4684c8f2bc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BaubleBar</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re tired of seeing the same old gold hoops offered over and over again and need something that’s an extension of your bubbly personality, then Baublebar, which is a favorite of celebrities, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Aniston and Julia Roberts</a>, believe it or not, is here to dress you up. There’s no shortage of colorful and poppy accessories, like this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Mary Kate bracelet</a>, or this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">bedazzled rainbow name bracelet</a>. While you can still find some more muted options (personally love this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">dainty anklet</a>), Baublebar is really more for the outgoing and the playful. On top of their standard offerings, they also have a line of<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"> customizable jewelry</a>, or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">fine jewelry</a>, all of which come at an affordable price point.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-oak-and-luna></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Oak and Luna</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=886 data-sizes=750px alt="oak &amp;amp; luna" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/R47l6xh6t-YJBE_rABJuqzDxCfQ=/fit-in/1500x886/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-05-01at4.39.04PM-f16cb38f9a6f496690e32eefeeafd422.png"><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond offering fun, trendy, and sentimental jewelry, Oak and Luna actually lets you decide what kind of material you want your jewelry to come in.

We’ve highlighted the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brand’s stud earrings</a> before, but outside of just earrings, their gorgeous dainty pieces of jewelry appeal to a wide range of people, as their simple yet elegant designs can easily be incorporated into everyday life.

You are going to see a whole lot of their Y2k-inspired jewelry on Netflix’s newest movie School for Good and Evil, as they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>designed an entire collection exclusively for their premier</a>e. But even without their big movie break, celebrities, like Bella Hadid, SZA, Ariana Grande, and Doja Cat, all have worn their chunky whimsical pieces, most of which are under $150.

This is the affordable jewelry brand for people who want a little more statement than a Mejuri, but not as in-your-face as a BONBONWHIMS. It’s that slight pop of color and design that adds a modest, yet noticeable statement to your look. Each piece is made to order and handmade in Queens, NY. Despite the one-of-a-kind piece you end up receiving, the price remains gentle on your wallet. Wear their pieces to a special occasion that requires a little more than a gold hoop but a little less than gems and diamonds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-catbird></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bMgONBrhAKVdvqmvSOH8S8udrro=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/catbird-6de5c4ee25284f1cbc17b14a75ece4d6.jpg"><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Wandering the streets of New York City, I’ve often stumbled across Catbird, a dainty little jewelry store in SoHo. As the allure of shiny things pulled me into the room, I marveled over the gorgeous minimalistic pieces on display — some were carved with intricate designs, while others held little diamonds up for admiration. For how high-end the pieces look, this woman-run business has (in my opinion) the most honest pricing system. You can find affordable jewelry below $200, alongside icy diamond rings well in their thousands. All pieces are designed, crafted, and shipped from their studio in Brooklyn using almost entirely recycled golds and diamonds, minimizing their carbon footprint significantly.

They craft affordable everyday pieces (found under “essentials” within each product category) alongside their more high-end 14k yellow, rose, and white golds. Each piece from the female-owned brand is handmade sustainably in Los Angeles and loved by celebs like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rosie Huntington</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Katie Holmes</a>.

Fine jewelry is typically made of responsibly-sourced gold, silver, and platinum or encrusted with diamonds and sapphires. Affordable jewelry on the other hand is often gold plated silver over other materials, such as copper, and bronze. The gold tends to wear off over time, revealing whatever material is used underneath. It’s also common for some people to experience rashes from certain metals, if they didn’t know they were allergic to the base material.&nbsp;If you’re looking for bracelets, necklaces, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>earrings for sensitive skin</a>, look for jewelry made with materials like gold, silver, and platinum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There is also gold filled jewelry, which contains a little more gold within the jewelry making it last longer.

Gold-filled materials have an additional two or three layers of solid gold covering the base.
