However, fans can hopefully look on the bright side and find solace in the fact that the adorable reality TV duo are releasing a cookbook together.</p><p>Joanna, 39, took to Instagram on Friday, Sept. 22, to let her fans know that they can soon learn how to make the same recipes she and Chip, 42, make at home. “After a week long photoshoot for our cookbook, celebrating with some homemade mac n cheese and brownie pie just feels right,” she wrote, adding that the cookbook will be titled Magnolia Table Cookbook.</p><p>The lifestyle guru’s announcement came just days after she and Chip broke fans’ hearts when they revealed that <a href=#>Fixer Upperwill be ending</a> after Season 5. It is with both sadness and expectation that we share the news that Season 5 of Fixer Upper will be our last,” the pair wrote on their blog. “While we are confident that this is the right choice for us, it has for sure not been an easy one to come to terms with. Our family has grown up alongside yours, and we have felt you rooting us on from the other side of the screen. How bittersweet to say goodbye to the very thing that introduced us all in the first place.”</p><p>They added, “We will forever be thankful for HGTV and this opportunity of a lifetime… Thank you for caring about these homes and these families and the things that we care so much about… Who knows what the future holds, but we’re excited for whatever is around the bend and in the meantime, we will definitely be staying in touch.”</p><p>Though their reality TV career is coming to a close, Chip and Joanna — who tied the knot in 2003 and share four children together — will still be keeping busy with a multitude of projects, including <a href=#>a lifestyle collection with Target</a>, launching in November. Despite their success as a couple, Chip and Joanna have been hit with divorce rumors in recent months.</p><p>In mid-September, <a href=#>Joanna shut down speculation</a> of a split. “I don’t do great with seeing that kind of stuff, reading into it — I just don’t know what’s going on. So then I’ll hear someone come up to me and say, ‘I hear you and Chip are getting a divorce!’ And I’ll be like, ‘Where did you hear that?’” she said. “I don’t know any of this!’ We do our due diligence in letting people know as much as we can, ‘This isn’t us. Don’t be scammed.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cn6KoXZ%2B8orrNmmSgmZmjsrR5wqimpJqfpLhufZNrcHJwXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
