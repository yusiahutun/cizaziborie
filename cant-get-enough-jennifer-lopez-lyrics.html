It’s described as a “genre-redefining immersive cinematic experience,” according to a press release and includes “an extravagant visual and sonic feast with impressive choreography, star-studded cameos, costumes, sets and blockbuster-worthy visuals.” Among the people involved with the movie is none other than J-Lo’s husband Ben Affleck.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jennifer-lopez-net-worth.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ben-affleck-britney-spears-kiss.png><p>So are the “Can’t Get Enough” by Jennifer Lopez lyrics about her love? Read more to find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-s-can-t-get-enough-by-jennifer-lopez-s-meaning>What’s “Can’t Get Enough” by Jennifer Lopez’s meaning?</h2><p>The song is a direct tribute to her love of Ben Affleck. It’s reported that J-Lo actually performed the song at her wedding reception for the Argo director. The song interpolates “I’m Still In Love With You” by Alton Ellis,&nbsp;which was also re-interpreted by&nbsp;Sean Paul&nbsp;and Sasha in their 2002 song of the same name.</p><p>In an interview with<a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d8fq0OFxOo&t=1785s" rel=nofollow> Zane Lowe </a>on his Apple Music 1 show, J-Lo described the process of writing the song. “[It feels like] authentic rhythms and melodies and more than anything, a feeling in the music, and I think that’s what a lot of people who heard the album in its early days were feeling, they were like, “There’s something true about this.” There’s something that feels gritty and honest and raw and real and vulnerable and brave about this music from all of these people, not just from me.I love it. I feel like “Can’t Get Enough” is a perfect way to kind of come out of the box with this one because it does have that like my performance energy.”</p><p>When describing her new music to <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.vogue.com/article/jennifer-lopez-upcoming-album-dedicated-to-ben-affleck>Vogue</a>, J-Lo said that the album will portray the “emotional, spiritual, and psychological journey she has taken over the past two decades.” This Is Me…Then included a song called “Dear Ben” while J-Lo decided to make a part two of the song which will be released alongside the album.</p><p>She also attributes the way her private life is perceived in public to what inspired the album. “People think they know things about what happened to me along the way, the men I was with—but they really have no idea, and a lot of times they get it so wrong. There’s a part of me that was hiding a side of myself from everyone. And I feel like I’m at a place in my life, finally, where I have something to say about it.”</p><p>Lopez and Affleck were previously engaged in 2003, after meeting on the set of the RomCom&nbsp;Gigli. The couple called it quits in 2004. “I am confirming the report that&nbsp;<a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a>&nbsp;has ended her engagement to&nbsp;<a href=#>Ben Affleck</a>,” J-Lo’s rep said in a statement at the time. “At this difficult time, we ask that you respect her privacy.” In her 2014 memoir,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>True Love</a>, J-Lo referred to her and Ben’s breakup as the “first real heartbreak” she experienced. “Ben and I split up at the moment when I thought we were committing to each other forever,” she wrote.&nbsp;“It was my first real heartbreak, it felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest.”</p><p>However, things got back on track when Ben and Jennifer&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>reunited</a>&nbsp;in 2021 after sixteen years apart. The pair rekindled their relationship in April 2021 following J-Lo’s split from Alex Rodriguez, whom she broke up with after four years together. At this time, Ben was already divorced from his ex-wife Jennifer Garner, in which they were together from 2005 to 2018.</p><p>The couple got married, not once, but twice. First with a chapel wedding in Las Vegas, Nevada, in June 2022, and followed by a more extravagant wedding in Ben’s estate in Georgia in August 2022. Let’s take a look below at the “Can’t Get Enough” Jennifer Lopez lyrics to see what she performed at the reception.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=can-t-get-enough-by-jennifer-lopez-lyrics>“Can’t Get Enough” by Jennifer Lopez Lyrics</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>Here are “Can’t Get Enough” by Jennifer Lopez lyrics via <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://genius.com/Jennifer-lopez-cant-get-enough-lyrics rel=nofollow>Genius</a>.</p><p>[Intro]<br>I just wanna<br>I just feel like, ooh<br>Every time I see ya<br>I just, ooh, hey (Get it, boy)</p><p>[Verse 1]<br>I feel like startin’ something<br>You got my engine runnin’<br>You got the keys to turn me on and on<br>You got me acceleratin’ want to celebrate it<br>Can’t nothing take me out my zone<br>It’s on</p><p>[Pre-Chorus]<br>When it feels right<br>Nothing else matters<br>Is this real life?<br>Too good to be true<br>Take me all night<br>I can feel the passion<br>In your eyes<br>I’m still in love with you</p><p>[Chorus]<br>You know I can’t get enough (I love that shit)<br>You know I can’t get enough (You love that shit)<br>You know I can’t get enough (Give me all that shit)<br>Can’t get enough<br>You know I can’t get enough (I love that shit)<br>You know I can’t get enough (You love that shit)<br>You know I can’t get enough (Give me all that shit)<br>Can’t get enough of you</p><p>[Post-Chorus]<br>I’m still in love<br>With you, boy</p><p>[Interlude]<br>I just wanna<br>I just feel like<br>Every time I see ya, it’s like<br>Oh, hey (Get it, boy)</p><p>[Verse 2]<br>Give me that touchin’, teasin’<br>So good I can’t believe it<br>Don’t wanna share with no one else<br>You’re always the one I needed (Needed)<br>Don’t gotta keep a secret (Secret)<br>But I let you keep me to yourself (Self)</p><p>[Pre-Chorus]<br>‘Cause, bae, it feels like<br>Nothing else matters<br>Is this real life?<br>Too good to be true<br>Take me all night<br>I can feel the passion<br>In your eyes<br>I’m still in love with you</p><p>[Chorus]<br>You know I can’t get enough (I love that shit)<br>You know I can’t get enough (You love that shit)<br>You know I can’t get enough (Give me all that shit)<br>Can’t get enough<br>You know I can’t get enough (I love that shit)<br>You know I can’t get enough (You love that shit)<br>You know I can’t get enough (Give me all that shit)<br>Can’t get enough of you</p><p>[Post-Chorus]<br>I’m still in love<br>With you, boy<br>I’m still in love<br>With you, boy</p><p>[Outro]<br>I can’t get enough of you<br>It’s the way you love me, the way you touch me<br>It’s the way you look at me<br>Can’t get enough (Can’t get enough)<br>Of you, boy</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
