But as she now approaches the later years of her life, Julianne is finding it harder to get a gig. “It’s <a href=#>very difficult to find parts</a>, no matter how old you are, no matter where you are and whether you’re a man or a woman,” Julianne once candidly shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-aesra-score=linkNewWindowWarning:1;>Marie Claire</a> in a January 2016 interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/julianne-moore-louis-vuittton.jpg><p>Julianne — who took home the Oscar for Best Actress for her role in Still Alice in 2015 — continued, “The movie industry is not in the business of finding good roles for actors or actresses. It is in the business of creating films that will make as much money as possible.”</p><p>In fact, The Big Lebowski star recently shared during Thursday, March 7’s episode of <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a><a href=#> With Andy Cohen</a>&nbsp;that she was dropped from playing a role in <strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong>‘s recent Oscar-nominated film <a href=#>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</a> Back in 2015,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>&nbsp;reported that she had left the film due to “creative differences” with writer <strong>Nicole Holofcener</strong>, but that wasn’t what happened, according to Julianne. “I didn’t leave that movie. I was fired,” she told Andy. “I think she didn’t like what I was doing.”</p><p>Either way, we couldn’t love Julianne as an actress any more than we do now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jrKWhkaO7pnnMqKarnV2nsrexwKWqZqyYmnquu9WinGasmJbBbrXNrKeiqpWZeqmx0WarqGWjqa6zwIyamq2hnpx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
