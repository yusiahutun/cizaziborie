While many of the events that make the list of music's worst concerts accidents were at rock shows, country music has also experienced its fair share of tragedy. A&nbsp;horrific <a href=#>shooting&nbsp;attack</a>&nbsp;at the Las Vegas Village during the 2017&nbsp;<a href=#>Route 91 Festival</a>&nbsp;(Sept. 29-Oct. 1, 2017)&nbsp;that left at least 58&nbsp;people dead and hundreds injured has become the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.</p><p>It has forever changed the music culture.</p><p><strong>Jake Owen, Chris Young Describe Las Vegas Shooting</strong></p><p><a href=#>Jason Aldean</a> was onstage during his headlining set when a&nbsp;shooter opened fire with an&nbsp;automatic weapon from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino onto a&nbsp;crowd of thousands of fans.&nbsp;<a href=#>Jake Owen</a>, <a href=#>Big &&nbsp;Rich</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kane Brown</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Young</a>&nbsp;and more were at the festival, with Owen — who performed just before Aldean — describing the scene as&nbsp;“chaos and fear in everyone’s eyes." iHeartRadio Festival was one week prior, and their Daytime Village event&nbsp;was in the same spot where fans gathered to enjoy some country music on Oct. 1.</p><p>Recall that seven people lost their lives at the 2011 Indiana State Fair when the stage collapsed due to a freak weather accident just before <a href=#>Sugarland</a> was set to perform. Other devastating events, like a bombing outside Manchester Arena following Ariana Grande's show in May of 2017, are fresh on our minds. That attack resulted&nbsp;in the death of more than 20 people.</p><p><strong>Photos Show Chaos, Humanity at the Route 91 Harvest Festival</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmsKeiqMFuv8eopq2hnpzAbsDRmp6enJmawG6t02aaqKaTmr%2B1v44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
