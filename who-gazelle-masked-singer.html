Season 10 Spoilers, Clues, Reveals</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-04-19</div><p>As one of the best voices this season (and maybe in the history of The Masked Singer), Gazelle is name on everyone’s lips. But <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who is Gazelle on The Masked Singer Season 10</a>. Keep reading our best guess to who Gazelle on The Masked Singer could be revealed to be.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Masked Singer</a>—also abbreviated as TMS—is Fox’s reality TV singing competition series, in which celebrities compete against each other in performances while wearing head-to-toe costumes and face masks to conceal their identities. Throughout the season, a panel of judges guess the celebrities’ identities based on their voices and clues provided before and after each performance. Each week, the contestant with the least amount of votes from the studio audience is eliminated and takes off their masks to reveal their identities.&nbsp;</p><p>The series, which premiered in 2019, is based on South Korea’s King of the Mask Singer, which follows a similar format. Since the premiere of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The King of the Mask Singer</a> in 2015, The Masked Singer has expanded to dozens of countries across the world including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Brazil.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was flypaper TV right from the get-go,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Singer</a> executive producer Craig Plestis told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2019 about why he wanted to produce the show in the United States. “I just knew right away this was a special show. It was unbelievable in its appeal — and the game play, spectacle, family-viewing…[and] it was this huge hit in Asia…. If we do the job here, it should work here.”</p><p>Plestis also explained how he convinced Fox to greenlight <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Singer</a> for a first season. “From the get-go, Fox asked how we were going to cast this. They were firm in saying, ‘We’re not going to do the show unless you get unbelievable talent for the show,’” he said. “It has to be recognizable names. When the masks come off, everyone has to recognize that face — or they have to have some huge credibility, either in sports, in entertainment, TV, film, music. Some people were easy to cast. They saw the potential of the show.”</p><p>He continued, “They loved the idea of being behind a mask and no one knowing who they were, and showing off the talent that no one knew that they even had. They got it right away. Some people said no. In the end, we got great names, and all of them are big in their field in one way or another. The stats that we have, between the Grammy winners [and other achievements], is really phenomenal. When we started putting together and looked at all the awards all these people have won, we realized we just don’t have one or two great people; we have 12 great people.”</p><p>Plestis also credited The Masked Singer‘s popularity to the pandemic, where the series saw double digit ratings for the first time in its run. “It didn’t surprise me 100 percent, only because the way we’ve always looked at this show is: We’re an island,” he told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://ew.com/awards/emmys/emmys-2020-masked-singer-producer-interview-season-4/>Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2020. “When people are so tired of the news cycle, what’s going on politically or just the pandemic, we’re just an escape from reality. It’s an hour for America to sit back and play a big guessing game, and for the families to come together. I really believe that’s the hidden secret in our show.”</p><p>He continued, “I’m online every time our show airs, just seeing what people are saying about it so I can learn how to do it better, and my team is as well, and the majority of the responses are ‘Thank you, Fox and the producers, for putting on a show that we can watch as a family.’ I think that’s lost on a lot of other shows. They’re very niche shows. And we really try to be broad for our broadcaster, where everybody from 8 to 80 can watch it and partake in it. I think it’s a lost art, but when you do it right and do it well, [the viewers] will show up. And that’s the secret recipe for The Masked Singer.”</p><p>But back to Gazelle on The Masked Singer Season 10. So <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who is Gazelle on The Masked Singer</a>?

Janel Parrish, an actress best known for the TV series Pretty Little Liars, is our best guess for Gazelle on The Masked Singer Season 10. Read on for the clues that support Janel Parrish as Gazelle.</p><p>The first clue to Gazelle’s identity is Gremlin in Season 4 (Week 1)</p><ul><li>Gremlin’s identity in The Masked Singer Season 4 was actor and boxer Mickey Rourke. Parrish and Rourke starred together in the 2018 movie Tiger.</li></ul><p>“After seeing a Broadway show at 6 years old, I knew that I wanted to perform for a living.” (Week 1)</p><ul><li>In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Broadway World</a> in 2017, Parrish revealed that she wanted to be a performer after seeing Phantom of the Opera on Broadway around the age of five years old. “My dad loves to tell this story. I must have been five? They loved musical theatre, so really, I thank them (and I blame them),” she said. “They were listening to Phantom of the Opera while taking me to pre-school and my dad heard singing in the background (on the high note in ‘Think of Me’). And he was like, ‘What was that?’ Meanwhile, I was just in the back, living my best life – singing. I don’t remember that obviously, but I do remember always loving musical theatre and wanting to sing-along in the car.” She continued, “Because of that experience, they took me to see Phantom of the Opera. It was the first musical I had ever saw on stage and I was just transfixed. Apparently I just turned to my parents and said, ‘I want to do that.’ So they let me audition for Les Misérables, and that was it. I was bit by the Broadway bug.”</li></ul><p>“When I was just a teenager, I took a huge chance and performed in a national talent competition, but I crashed and burned.” (Week 1)</p><ul><li>When she was 14 years old, Parrish competed on the 2003 series, Star Search, on which she performed the song “On My Own” from Les Miserables.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Hawaiian shirt (Week 1)</p><ul><li>Parrish was born in Kāne’ohe, Honolulu, Hawaii.</li></ul><p>Poster with “Hello Doll!”</p><ul><li>Parrish starred in the 2007 movie Bratz based on the dolls of the same name.

There were a lot of times I didn’t know if there was a place for me in the entertainment industry.” (Week 2)</p><p>“Casting directors couldn’t figure out where I fit because of my unique look.” (Week 2)</p><ul><li>In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>SheKnows</a> in 2015, Parrish opened up about how she din’t know if there was a “place” for her in Hollywood because she was mixed race. (Parrish is of Chinese, English, Irish, and German descent.) “Being a mixed-race actress was very difficult, especially growing up,” she said. “When you’re younger and you have to fit into a family and you’re of mixed race, you don’t quite fit into the Hollywood look — which is usually the blond-haired, blue-eyed girl next door — and so I would audition for those roles, and they didn’t quite know where to place me,” she said. She continued, “Now that I’m older and I don’t really have to fit into a family in roles, it’s not that much of an issue, and I think also Hollywood and the world has become a little less color-blind, which is wonderful.”</li></ul><p>Test with an “A” on it (Week 2)</p><p>Football with “villain” + “I’m not actually a villain, but I can play the part. Gazelle’s got range!” (Week 2)</p><ul><li>Parrish’s character on Pretty Little Liars was revealed as the series’ first “A”—a villain who stalks and threatens the four main characters—in the Season 2 finale.</li></ul><p>“Deer are really meaningful to me because they are a symbol of someone I loved and lost” One of the most important people to her and her husband died right before their wedding. (Week 3)</p><ul><li>Parrish got a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>deer tattoo</a> on her neck in July 2019. The tattoo came a year after her father-in-law was was killed by a drunk driver two weeks before her wedding to her husband, Chris Long, in 2018.</li></ul><p>“Gazellez Love Story.”</p><p>“The 2000s are a special time for me because it was when I had my film debut.” (Week 3)</p><ul><li>Parrish starred in her first movie, Bratz, in 2007.

Scherzinger’s exit came after she was cast as Norma Desmond in the West End’s revival of the musical Sunset Boulevard in London. In an interview With <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a> in September 2023, Scherzinger confirmed that she would be open to returning to The Masked Singer and would like to be a judge on the series for as long as it runs. “Oh my gosh, I would love to, are you kidding me?” she said. “I love my [Masked Singer] family. And it’s such a great job. Are you kidding? I love it. Yes.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2019, Scherzinger explained why she believed The Masked Singer was so successful. “What’s so special and enduring about the show is that it’s crazy and it’s a bit trippy, but then you have the softer side, where people come on and feel a sense of redemption and a feeling of transformation and growth through this process,” Scherzinger said. “I just love the fact that these contestants feel like the world has judged them [or] feel like the world places a lot of judgment on them, and they want to be able to share who they really are. Not by what they think they are but who they are in their heart.”</p><p>She continued, “When the show came out and I saw how much people were enjoying it and gravitating towards it, I was happy for everyone cause they were the brave ones, the first ones to do it and say, ‘I wanna be a part of this show. I wanna have the courage to share my side of my story.’ So, I hope the contestants are really proud and happy they were a part of the show.”</p><p>McCarthy also confirmed in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2023 that she’s open to judging on The Masked Singer for as many seasons as it runs. “I have 30 more seasons in me,” McCarthy said, adding that her job&nbsp; “literally feels like a little bit of a dream.” She continued, “I’m hoping this is a show that can go on and on, like American Idol. [And] why not? There are a lot of celebrities that can sing and are hiding it.”</p><p>Thicke, for his part added, “It’s happened so fast. I can’t believe it, because it’s literally one of my favorite things to do in life, and that I’ve ever done in my career. Coming here with my friends and getting to watch these amazing performances and the craziness and the audience, it is so much fun.” He continued, “And now we have a bigger audience than we’ve ever had before. So it’s really a blessing on top of blessing.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11.914691943128><h2><strong>Who’s The Masked Singer host for Season 10?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Masked-Singer-Host.jpg><p>The Masked Singer Season 10 host is Nick Cannon, who has hosted the series since Season 1. Before The Masked Singer, Cannon hosted America’s Got Talent from Seasons 4 to 11.&nbsp;</p><p>Cannon told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Newsweek</a> in 2018 about why he wanted to host The Masked Singer. “They take what happens on that set so seriously about not letting the word out because it’s a mystery show. They say, ‘It’s not a who done it, it’s a who sung it,’” he said. “You’re wondering who is behind these elaborate, ridiculous costumes. It’s the fun of the show. Obviously, a lot of these people have amazing voices. Some of these people have horrible voices. The idea [is] you’re trying to guess what celebrity that is. You’ve got a little bit of Dancing with the Stars. You’ve got a little bit of The Voice. You’ve got a little bit of Halloween. It’s truly probably one of the most fun shows I’ve ever been a part of.”</p><p>He also told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> in 2020 about how he was hesitant to host another series after leaving America’s Got Talent. “I was really meticulous about what I would want to host again in the space of nonscripted variety since I had done it on the biggest level with AGT. I didn’t want to jump in and host another talent show,” Cannon said. “From the very first day I was on pins and needles hoping that no one falls off the stage in those costumes.” Cannon also confirmed that even he doesn’t know who the celebrities are under the costumes before they’re revealed. “All of the secrecy is so inconvenient. Everyone is kept so separate in their own little areas. I can’t see the talent. They arrive in secret locations,” he said. “It wouldn’t be as much fun if I knew who it was.”</p><p><br>The Masked Singer airs on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on Fox.</p><p>Our mission at StyleCaster is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
