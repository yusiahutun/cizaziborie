The pair first met on the film’s set and would go on to star in two sequels together, Far From Home and No Way Home. There were rumors about the pair being romantically linked from the start, but things only became officially confirmed in 2021. They’re still going strong, and that strength could lead to Tom on bended knee sooner than we think…</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/Copy-of-Templates-169-2024-04-11T114534.925-1024x559.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-there-has-been-talk-of-marriage-between-zendaya-and-tom-holland>There has been ‘talk of marriage’ between Zendaya and Tom Holland</h2><p>Fans smitten with the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> have been hoping to hear wedding bells for quite some time, and the two tying the knot is becoming more and more of a possibility.</p><p>“There has been talk of marriage, and that is a reality,” a source recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> to PEOPLE.</p><p>“They are not the kind of stars who put their lives together out there on social media for the most part,” the source included, suggesting that it could be some time before fans discover the big news, in the event they do become engaged.</p><p>“Both are private,” the source added, highlighting that widespread attention on their love life “has never been easy or comfortable for either of them.”</p><p>That being said, the two 27-year-olds are amongst the most popular actors working today, with <a href=#>Zendaya</a> having a particularly big year thanks to <a href=#>movies</a> like the sci-fi epic Dune: Part Two, as well as the steamy <a href=#>sports drama Challengers</a>, in theaters from this Friday.
