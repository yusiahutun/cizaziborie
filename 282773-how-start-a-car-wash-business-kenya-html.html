Profits aside, maintaining the car wash is also an area most people ignore and end up with no customers and in debt. Technology also contributes to the success of this business. Electric pumps help ensure vehicles are cleaner by reaching some parts of the car a human hands cannot access.</p><h2>Starting a car wash business in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>So, how do you start a car wash business in Kenya? Well, the first thing needed is money. You can acquire the money needed from a bank as a loan, or from friends and family. However, if the amount of cash you have can finance the steps below, then your car wash business in Kenya will be off and running in no time. If you do not wish to start this business from scratch, there are plenty of car wash business for sale in Kenya.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8365390ff63d1457.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Worst businesses to start in Kenya: The top 10 list</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, if you want to own the company from its inception, then follow this car wash business plan in Kenya to guarantee success.</p><h3><strong>1. Identify a piece of land and lease or purchase it</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Land identification is vital for your car wash business because it aids in determining the flow of customers. There is no way your enterprise will flourish in an area with poor living standards and low traffic. The best area to purchase or lease land for your car wash business would be close to a residential area or a famous getaway location. A car wash next to a <i>nyama choma</i> restaurant or bar and grill is a cash cow for the diligent Kenyan.</p><p class=align-left>You will have all the time in the world to wash the cars while the owners take a pint or enjoy some food. Ensure that the car wash location is easily accessible and has all the exposure you can provide. Not to mention, the terrain should be away from areas with physical obstructions such as electric poles, ditches, or too many trees should be avoided. Other suitable areas to buy or lease land for a car wash business in Kenya include shopping malls, public facilities, and churches to mention a few.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b3b534dcc21cf29.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 10 best businesses to start with 200k in Kenya in 2022</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While scouting for locations, ensure the area you pick has a steady water supply. Water coming from a natural source is a bonus seeing it can never run out without your knowledge. You can also dig a borehole or a well but ensure you treat it regularly. Lastly, ensure you set aside an area for tanks, which should always be filled with water when your business takes off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8365390ff63d1457.jpg><h3><strong>2. Rehabilitate the land</strong></h3><p class=align-left>One thing most people forget when they are on the ‘seller’ end of any business is that customers are attracted to decency as much as they are engrossed in efficiency. It is not advisable to start a car wash without rehabilitating the land through removing barriers or fencing the area. Digging trenches and leveling up the ground are also essential processes when renovating the property.</p><p class=align-left>If the money is enough, consider covering the ground with concrete. It helps maintain the ground level while adding to your car wash’s beauty. After this is done, you can create some anticipation by placing a ‘car wash coming soon’ banner at the entrance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f64df660b27019b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a tour company successfully in Kenya</span></p></a><h3><strong>3. Applying for a license</strong></h3><p class=align-left>If land ownership or leasing is verified, you can now proceed to the third step. The kind of license required for opening a car wash business in Kenya is called a single business permit. It is issued by the local government, but there is no fixed figure regarding its cost. As such, the price of this license might vary from one county to another. If you intend to open a very big carwash, consider seeking clearance from the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA).</p><p class=align-left>Most people know that corruption has taken down more bright ideas than anything else in this country. There have been endless court hearings regarding land that has been dragged for ages dwindling progress in the intended business. As such, if the area in which you wish to set up a car wash has some land issues, be sure to skip part two and start by applying for a license. It makes no sense to prepare for everything then get disappointed at the beginning of the race.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/da07c28b88f77346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dreamline buses online booking routes, fares, and contacts</span></p></a><h3><strong>4. Get the necessary equipment</strong></h3><p class=align-left>The success of your car wash business in Kenya 2018 hugely relies on the type of equipment you purchase. Technology has introduced innovations that make washing a car seem natural while reducing the amount of labour and improving the quality of the wash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b3b534dcc21cf29.jpg><h4><strong>Washing machine</strong></h4><p class=align-left>For any serious investor, the first thing you should purchase for this business is a pressure washing machine. These machines come in different capacities, from different brands, and can be new or used.</p><p class=align-left>Purchasing one should be determined by the estimated number of cars that will frequent your car wash on a daily basis. Your best bet is a durable machine; the extra coin might hurt the budget, but it guarantees longevity. However, if you are on a budget, a low capacity model will do before your car wash business brings in enough money for an upgrade. The fuel type used by the pressure washing machine is also a significant factor to consider.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8c74843a8cba2215.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 profitable businesses to start with 50k in Kenya (top ideas)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Kenyans are just about fed up with power outages, which not only irritate the locals but also halts some businesses. If the area you intend to set up your car wash has a history of regular power outages, consider buying petrol or diesel-powered pressure washing machine. However, the former is better considering it guarantees superior performance. As far as the model is concerned, all you need to look at are the features that come with every brand.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the features to look out for include a spray gun, pressure options, anti-twist systems, weight, and dust blasting to mention a few. The more the features, the higher your chances are of improving service delivery on your automatic car wash business in Kenya. Washing pressure machines are available in leading supermarkets across the country with popular brands such as Karcher and Honda dominating the market.</p><h4><strong>Water tank</strong></h4><p class=align-left>As mentioned earlier, water tanks are essential for the success of your car wash business. These come in different capacities as well ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 litres. The size of the water tank you prefer should be based on the availability of water in the area you wish to establish your car wash business. The bigger the tank, the better.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ff222501a918b0dc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything you need to know about motorbikes for sale in Kenya</span></p></a><h4><strong>Vacuum Cleaner, brushes, squeezers, towels, detergents, and buckets</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Purchasing a vacuum cleaner for a car wash business is different from when you're buying the same equipment for your house. Request to be directed to the area with commercial vacuum cleaners. These vacuum cleaners have more features and are not made for limited usage like their counterparts. The buckets, squeezers, towels, and brushes don't have to follow specific criteria or meet certain standards, but the higher the quality, the better.</p><p class=align-left>As for the detergents, make sure you don't make your purchase at the local shop or supermarket. There are specialized detergents meant for washing vehicles, and they can be found in some local stores. They are perfumed and can enable your car wash to stand out from the competition. However, some people are allergic to strong smells so be sure to ask your customers and have a variety of options such as mild or strong-smelling for said detergents.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/86083512a5b2253a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Used cars for sale in Kenya: 10 cheapest models and their prices</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While purchasing the equipment above, be sure also to consider some of the services you're going to offer at your car wash. Some of the most common services include body washing, upholstery, interior cleaning, under wash, waxing, dusting, buffing, carpet cleaning, and engine wash. Some of these services might require equipment that is only found in high-end car wash businesses, but you need them to ensure a steady flow of clients.</p><h2>Just how profitable is car wash business in Kenya?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs7egtnbtd6pq.jpg><p class=align-left>Car wash business ideas in Kenya have brought about the emergence of small towns due to the setting up of bars and restaurants and other facilities in the area.
