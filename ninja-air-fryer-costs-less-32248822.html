I didn't buy it, it was my husband. I cannot deny doubting it and not wanting it, to be honest. However, after two weeks of trying out different recipes, I am impressed. It's also so easy to clean. None of the drama and turmoil of cleaning an oven. Simply pop the pans into your dishwasher or bowl of hot water and washing up liquid, and hey presto, you're done."</p><p>Another reviewer sang its praises and said: "I have been reluctant to jump on the air fryer band wagon so have held back from buying this. Thought it was all hype and as I often cook for six people didn't think this fryer would be any benefit to me. I was wrong. It is not just the ease with which it cooks, it's the way it cooks food! ".</p><p>"The air fryer offers a succulent finish to meat, a crispy finish to potatoes and other foods besides. I regularly cook a whole chicken which I use for salad lunches. I use it for late comers to heat up or cook fresh where before they had to make do with a warm or micro waved offering. We have all enjoyed fajitas, sausages, bacon...so much to enjoy."</p><p>But not everyone is chuffed with their air fryer. Some folks find the Ninja Foodi MAX Dual Zone Air Fryer a bit of a headache, with one person saying: "Not the easiest thing to use. Rather complicated machine. Hard to clean. Very bulky.
