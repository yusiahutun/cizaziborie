So what does that mean?</p><p>Well, the latest post on his <a href=#><strong>Instagram</strong></a> page is a shot of him holding a tennis shoe up to his ear, but it's the caption that could suggest what he's thinking.

Like his IG post, he captioned this share, "machine." So is he seriously looking to change his name?</p><p>Well, it may not be as clear as that. The original video was actually from a year ago and the fans were a comedy duo named Chad and JT, per <a href=#><strong>Entertainment Weekly</strong></a>.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.</p><p>The exchange shown was real, but it was the duo that resurfaced their video to <a href=#><strong>TikTok</strong></a> last week after MGK asked the press to call him "machine" at the GQ Men of the Year event, calling it proof that their gambit from a year ago had worked. But did it?</p><p>The rocker/rapper leaned into the narrative with his social media posts. But, at least according to EW, MGK plans to keep all three parts of his name for the foreseeable future, making his responses on the QG carpet even more inexplicable.</p><p>The "machine" posts also remain the most recent updates on his social media platforms, with no explanations offered. Maybe he's been mulling it over for a year and he's still mulling.</p><a id=gallery-link-ce48ffa0-d56d-4d55-b826-0bcf43707778 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ce48ffa0-d56d-4d55-b826-0bcf43707778 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:3412a7b7-21d3-4200-8591-9f1cb555a00d data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/be/4by3/2023/11/24/be4613d75b174233b26c98acdf74c188_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpma25foq6ktMinnGafpaN6rLHLpbBmm5%2Bjwaa5z6WYraGenHqvrcyeZJygkaO0pnnNqKtmn5ykv6qy2GaerqajZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
