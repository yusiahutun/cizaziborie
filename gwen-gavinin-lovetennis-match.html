They appeared at ease, laughing together and sharing affectionate glances as Gavin sat with his arm around his talented wife, who rested her head on his shoulder. Despite their marital bliss, the day didn't end as the couple hoped it would, with Roger losing to Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus.</p><p id=edbswJWwdO data-wc=121>Gwen and Gavin were joined by their adorable tots the following day, when they got in plenty of family time. The foursome relaxed and played outside, with little Zuma basking in the warm weather in just a T-shirt and nappy while mum Gwen snapped photos of her boys. The singer recently revealed to US that being a mum is both "awesome" and "hard". The style-savvy star discussed her sons, explaining that they are quite different. "Kingston didn’t like the fans on tour," she said. "He doesn’t like having his photo taken or the paparazzi. “Zuma is more of a show-off. He wants everyone to watch him, and he’s a goofball, and he’s really silly. He’s a funny guy.”</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
