That's when she confronted James over the claims inside their room at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in D.C. last week. When police approached the room asking if someone had been shot, she reportedly responded, "F--- him, he's a child molester."</p><p>Weems reportedly told police she grabbed a gun from her purse and shot her husband when he made a move toward her during the heated discussion. Police found two guns on the scene, as well as a notebook in which Shanteari seemingly wrote about her plans to shoot James. She also told police she didn't want to kill her husband, but only hurt him.</p><p>Her notebook allegedly contained notes like, "I want [Victim 1] to face the world as scum," "I want these kids to get justice, and you gonna pay" and "My only regret for me is that I didn't put the bullet in your head." The book also reportedly included an apology to her own children and "an informal last will and testament," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WJLA</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1000aae9-6492-4c6a-a857-583b4d496e6f data-container-ref=toofab:article:32109e33-a7fb-46d5-b98a-6a9bfb7baad2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/64/5by4/2022/07/18/6407eddf99e0465bbf49c4502f78fb7d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook / Jackson County Sheriff's Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Man Dies Days After Sister Wakes from 2-Year Coma and Names Him As Her Attacker</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Days after the shooting, on Tuesday, July 26, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baltimore County Police issued an arrest warrant for James</a>, "after allegations surfaced that Weems sexually abused at least three children while working at a daycare facility located in Owings Mills."</p><p>Per the press release, Baltimore PD began investigating Weems "earlier this month after they were notified of the abuse" -- and said he faces multiple charges.</p><p>"We're not going to get into the specifics of the allegations at this point since it does remain an open investigation and additional charges may be filed in this matter," Joy Lepola-Stewart, spokesperson for Baltimore County police, told CBS.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:57363c28-6bc5-482b-bd5f-8b009cd39901 data-container-ref=toofab:article:32109e33-a7fb-46d5-b98a-6a9bfb7baad2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/19/5by4/2022/07/21/196839fe5df64d5a9bf4ed46d766d0c3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook / White Ridge Police Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Terrifying Ring Camera Video Shows Wigged Duo Pull Gun on Couple They Followed Home from Walk</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>James, meanwhile, was still hospitalized and in police custody as of Tuesday in D.C., pending extradition to Baltimore County.</p><p>Shanteari is due in court on Friday.
