Yes, the black ink that originally covered the whites of his eyes has been applied by Cobra Luna, a tattoo artist who has earned the title of “inventor of the eyeball tattoo.”</p><p>“It took me six years to think if I actually wanted to get it or not,” Quest&nbsp;shared in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok video</a> earlier this month. He explained that he wore blackout contacts for 30 days before making the big decision. “I loved it, and then it took six more years because it was very expensive.”</p><p>The tattoo collector claims that he paid $5,000 for each eye, for a grand total of $10,000 when the operation was completed in 2021. Quest was required to hold his own eyelids open during the process so that the tattoo artist could inject four doses of pigment into his eyeball. “He would hardly touch it to rub it around after he would do each shot,” the Las Vegas-based influencer recollected in a TikTok on October 1. “Now, it’s permanent.”</p><p>Quest has spent around 70K tattooing during the course of 13 years.</p><p>In response to a user’s question regarding maybe getting an eyeball tattoo removed later, he said that Quest couldn’t do that. “This is a question: can you get your eyeball tattoos removed? And that’s a huge no. And that’s why it took me six years to actually think if I wanted to get it or not. I actually got the contacts that everyone thinks I’m wearing now…”</p><h3><strong>Quest Gulliford Job</strong></h3><p>Quest Gulliford has been working as a Social Media Manager at Sullen Clothing since September 2018.
