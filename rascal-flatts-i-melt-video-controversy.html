The music video's nudity caused controversy within the band, too.

Jay DeMarcus, in fact, now says he was ready to walk away from their rising career because of it.</p><p>"I&nbsp;stormed off of the set because I was very angry that we were gonna put nudity in our video. That is the truth," the singer — who is often more silly than serious in interviews — shared during a recent media event. "I&nbsp;almost quit the band that day because our manager ... did not tell me, and they sprung it on my at the shoot."</p><p>Even though it wasn't DeMarcus himself who'd have to strip down for the scene, the devout Christian was concerned about what the response would be.</p><p>"I&nbsp;thought, 'My Lord, I'll never be able to go back to Lee University again or stick my head in a baptist church anywhere once this comes out,'" he recalls, later adding that he's pretty sure no one told him about the plan in advance "'cause I think they knew what my reaction was gonna be."</p><p>The finished video assuaged DeMarcus' fears: "It was tastefully done, and you could go, 'Oh, that's not as bad,'" he says. However, after some networks banned the clip, a version in which Rooney's bare butt was pixelated was put together — Rascal Flatts admit that made the scene seem a lot worse than it was.</p><p>All that buzz worked in&nbsp;the Flatts' favor, however: The Gary LeVox, Neil Thrasher and Wendell Mobley-penned "I Melt" became a major hit for the trio. They started getting booked for talk shows and moving to a new level in their career.</p><p>"The ball was starting to roll, and then, I mean, who would have known it would have taken ... Joe Don's butt to really blow that song out of the water?" LeVox muses, joking that Rooney's performance was "Emmy worthy."</p><p>"Yeah, it took Joe Don's butt to blow "I Melt" up ... and we've been kissing his butt ever since," he adds playfully.</p><p>Rascal Flatts are celebrating 20 years as a band in 2020. At the start of the year, they announced a farewell tour and their intentions to disband at the end of the year. The novel coronavirus pandemic put those tour plans on ice, but on Friday (Oct. 2), they'll release<a href=#> a greatest hits album</a>&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;13 of their No. 1 songs and seven other fan favorites.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>What's the Best Country Song of the 2000s?
