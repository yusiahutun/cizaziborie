You simply have to sign up for an account, and then you'll gain access to the drag and drop backyard design tool.</p><p>Upon opening the tool, you'll be presented with a sketch of a home. You can click <strong>Change Background</strong> to change the image to any of the other sketches listed here, which consist of various styles of homes and yards. If you can't find one that's similar to your own home, you can even upload your own picture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you've chosen an image, you can sift through the elements on the left side of the screen. In the <strong>Plants</strong> section, you'll find trees, bushes, and vegetables that you can drag and drop into your design. The <strong>Structures</strong> tab houses a variety of lawn decor that you can drop in to your yard, while <strong>Textures</strong> lets you "paint" in a lawn or patio.</p><p>Unfortunately, some of the elements are locked behind a paywall, but there are still plenty of free plants, structures, and textures to choose from.</p><h2 id=gardena-mygarden-planner>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gardena myGarden Planner</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/gardena.jpg><p>The Gardena myGarden tool is very handy, especially if you're looking to install a <a href=#>smart sprinkler system</a>.

You don't need to use any complex calculations to place your sprinklers or pipeline, as Gardena will automatically do that for you based on the size of your yard.</p><h2 id=vegplotter>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VegPlotter</a></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To visualize this season's crops, register for an account on VegPlotter and design your garden.
