We are pleased that we found a way to bring it back and give closure to the show's storylines and characters, which audiences deserve. Once again, we appreciate the talents and efforts of the cast, writers, producers and crew and everyone who has contributed to the success of S.W.A.T.

Posting on Twitter, he shared an iconic photograph of Harry Truman holding up a Chicago newspaper, which is famed for featuring an erroneous headline. The text had been photoshopped to say "CBS cancels S.W.A.T," instead of the original "Dewey Defeats Truman" – a cheeky reference to the fact that the show's cancelation has become 'fake' news.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Meet the cast of S.W.A.T. season six&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/697d1bb2c0e1-shemar-moore-as-hondo.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5a2de91339ec-rochelle-aytes-swat.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/718f778722e9-jay-harrington-deacon-kay-swat.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fc94385bd52a-alex-russell-jim-street.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/bb7791433c30-david-lim-as-victor-swat.jpg><p id=e-hxBi3Sik data-wc=26></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
