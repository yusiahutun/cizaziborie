As the coronavirus pandemic continues to turn the human race into shut-ins, the King of Redneck Jokes, comedian Jeff Foxworthy, started his quarantine life with an all new look: No mustache!
&#34;First time I’ve shaved my mustache in 40 years ... clearly I’m bored in quarantine,&#34; Foxworthy writes on his Instagram.
For those who think it's just a mustache, think again."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That push broom&nbsp;of iconic facial hair has been a part of Foxworthy's brand at least since his 1993 triple-Platinum album You Might Be a Redneck If...</p><p>That was the album that put Foxworthy on the map, and though he considers his comedy more of a storytelling style, the Georgia native has become&nbsp;synonymous with one-liner redneck jokes. In a <a href=#>past interview with Taste of Country</a>, Foxworthy even shared how how his legacy of a redneck joke teller began — in a Michigan bowling alley.</p><p>“When I did the first redneck joke, it was just a response to someone calling me a redneck,” Foxworthy tells Taste of Country.</p><p>“We were at a club in Michigan; the club was attached to a bowling alley that had valet parking and I said, you don’t think you have rednecks in Michigan? Look out the window, people are valet parking at the bowling alley," he says. "So I go back to the hotel and I said, I know I’m a redneck but apparently a lot of people don’t know they’re one and I wrote 10 ways to tell (if you’re a redneck). I went back the next night, not thinking this is going to be a hook or a book, I’m just trying to come up with standup. But then people not only laughed, they were pointing at each other, so I thought there might be something here.”</p><p>Foxworthy was right, and he built a 20-plus year career on the foundation of hilarious one-liners&nbsp;and a great mustache. Does he spend the next 13 days in quarantine trying to grow it back? We'll have to see.</p><p><strong>The Cadillac Three's Live "Hard Out Here for a Country Boy" Is Really Rockin'</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo52Wm3qnu9ewpqusmK56tLTAr5ydZZ2qwLWtwqGcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
