 What do Bill Clinton and Prince Charles have in common? The answer: rosacea, a ruddy complexion that in some cases can mistakenly be attributed to a problem with alcohol."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The answer: rosacea, a ruddy complexion that in some cases can mistakenly be attributed to a problem with alcohol.<br></p><p>This is only one of the challenges facing those with the debilitating skin condition rosacea (pronounced rose-ay-sha). Many have never heard of it and assume their red face and flushing are merely a sign of ageing.&nbsp;</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/18/article-1339518-0C7B05CD000005DC-157_224x400.jpg height=400 width=224 alt="Bill Clinton" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/18/article-1339518-0012772B1000044C-157_224x400.jpg height=400 width=224 alt="Prince Charles" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Bill Clinton (left) and Prince Charles (right) both have rosacea, a ruddy complexion. It can be treated effectively in most people<br></p><p>While there are undoubtedly more sufferers over the age of 40, there are still others in their early 20s or 30s who have not been diagnosed&nbsp; -&nbsp; surprising given that it affects one in ten of those in the UK.<br></p><p>Rosacea can be treated effectively in most people. However, there are no quick fixes, and if it cannot be cured it is vital to find a way to keep it under control.<br></p><h2><span>SPOT THE SIGNS</span><br></h2><ul><li>Facial redness, most commonly covering the nose and cheeks.<br></li><li>Acne-like spots.<br></li><li>Red flash on face (butterfly shape over nose and cheeks)<br></li><li>Broken veins on nose and cheeks.<br></li><li>Swollen and tender skin.<br></li><li>Extreme sensitivity to temperature changes.<br></li><li>Flushing and blushing.</li></ul><h2><span>RED AND SORE</span></h2><p>Leaving rosacea undiagnosed may lead to worsening of the symptoms. More complicated problems include enlargement of the nose (rare) and severe broken veins or permanent redness. Having a red face can feel painful, sore, inflamed, swollen and tender and leave the skin feeling so sensitive it cannot tolerate water.<br></p><h2><span>WHEN SHOULD I SEE A DOCTOR?</span><br></h2><p>If you feel your face burning, stinging, itching, tender, raw, sore or in pain on a regular basis, see your doctor. You may be advised to take painkillers to help control these symptoms.<br></p><p>A doctor may prefer to categorise rosacea into mild, moderate or severe cases, although it is possible for a person to have mild symptoms one day and severe flare-ups the next.<br></p><p>Treatment will depend upon the symptoms you experience. Some commonly prescribed antibiotics, for example, have a positive effect on inflammation but will do nothing (or little) to help with flushing.<br></p><h2><span>WHO GETS IT?</span><br></h2><p>While the causes of rosacea are not yet clear, certain people are more likely to get it: if one or both parents had it, their skin is a typical Celtic colouring, or they are prone to blushing. It affects both sexes, yet more women are reported to have the condition. It occurs mainly after the age of 30.<br></p><h2><span>ARE BLUSHING AND FLUSHING THE SAME?</span><br></h2><p>A survey revealed that 45 per cent of those with rosacea found flushing to be the worst symptom of their condition, and 13 per cent said they avoided socialising because of this. The words blush and flush often get confused but their meanings are the same&nbsp; -&nbsp; to turn red on the face, neck, ears and even upper chest, accompanied by a feeling of intense heat in those areas. Besides rosacea, other illnesses&nbsp; -&nbsp; such as a high temperature or emphysema&nbsp; -&nbsp; can cause flushing, as can emotions from stress to embarrassment.<br></p><h2><span>AVOID YOUR TRIGGERS</span><br></h2><p>Many factors may set off rosacea, including foods. Keeping a diary should help you pinpoint them.<br></p><ul><li>Nearly 75 per cent of sufferers reported that stress alone was responsible for flare-ups. l Extremes of temperature are a key trigger. Cold weather leaves the skin feeling extremely tingly, as does wind for those with rosacea.<br></li><li>Spicy food can trigger a flush response.<br></li><li>Alcohol can exacerbate symptoms so badly that many with rosacea will avoid drinking alcohol in public.<br></li><li>Caffeine is not a trigger. But the heat from a hot drink may irritate the skin and set off symptoms.<br></li><li>44 per cent blamed foods, including tomatoes, cheese (except cottage), spinach, yogurt, plums, raisins, vinegar, yeast-containing foods, chocolate and marinated foods.<br></li></ul><h2><span>TOPICAL ANTIBIOTICS AND NATURAL SOOTHERS</span><br></h2><p>Treating rosacea with topical&nbsp; -&nbsp; or applied&nbsp; -&nbsp; gels, creams or lotions can give results as good as antibiotic tablets. Taking any type of antibiotic can give excellent results but may need to be used long term for continual benefit.<br></p><ul><li>Evening Primrose oil supplements are packed full of natural fatty acids that help the body fight inflammation.<br></li><li>Ginger is claimed to reduce redness and inflammation. It can also help reduce cholesterol and may have blood-thinning effects, so it should not be taken with the anticoagulant Warfarin.<br></li><li>Marigold extract calendula can be taken as a tincture or as a capsule. It is an ancient treatment for inflammatory conditions.<br></li><li>Milk thistle helps to protect and enhance liver function, which is believed by some to contribute to the cause of rosacea</li></ul><h2><span>IS MY FLUSHING JUST THE MENOPAUSE?</span></h2><p>Hot flushes in menopausal women affect not only the face but the whole body too. These are triggered by the hypothalamus in the brain, which acts as a heat controller.<br></p><p>This is similar to a thermostat which&nbsp; -&nbsp; triggered by menopausal changes&nbsp; -&nbsp; has been set slightly too low, tricking the brain into believing the body is too hot; the brain responds with a flush in an attempt to cool the body.<br></p><p>The hormone oestrogen is responsible for stabilising the hypothalamus and it is the reduction in this during menopause that triggers hot flushes. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may help control this type of flushing.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span style=font-weight:700;font-style:italic>Acne And Rosacea: The Complete Guide, by Alison Bowser, published by Vermilion, £10.99.</span><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCVlrm1tI6aqa2hk6Gybn2SbHBuaWhkj6q4y2Z6paGeqbyvea%2BroKeblWKQqa3RpZysZXmpwG6%2BzqyYnJ2RYsC1wc%2Bim2ZlopqxbrLAnKCapF2buba%2Fx56qZpuRqsCmsIydnJuhnJ7BosDIp55mq5ueu26vzqeboqyZpLtvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
