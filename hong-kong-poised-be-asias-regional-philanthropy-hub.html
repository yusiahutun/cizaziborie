Hong Kong is the obvious and natural choice for four reasons.
First, Hong Kong has a long and impressive history of philanthropy shaped by three forces: British colonialism, Chinese values and a laissez faire state. When the British ruled Hong Kong, they followed a policy of “positive non-intervention”, which meant that trade was the focal point of government, while delivering social services such as health and education remained for the most part outside the government’s remit."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hong Kong is the obvious and natural choice for four reasons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">First, Hong Kong has a long and impressive history of philanthropy shaped by three forces: British colonialism, Chinese values and a laissez faire state. When the British ruled Hong Kong, they followed a policy of “positive non-intervention”, which meant that trade was the focal point of government, while delivering social services such as health and education remained for the most part outside the government’s remit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fortunately, Chinese clan traditions and Christian missionary activities filled the void, with non-profits, still among the most important today, playing a critical role in delivering social services. Storied organisations such as Tung Hwa hospitals, St James' Settlement and Haven of Hope were established during the colonial era and continue to thrive in a city where the government takes a somewhat non-interventionist approach.</p>Second, Hong Kong is home to some of the world’s greatest philanthropists. Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Centre for Asian Philanthropy and Society, is known along with his brother for <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">donating</span></a> the largest gift ever received by Harvard University, some US$350 million, to Harvard’s School of Public Health.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Just as importantly, Hong Kong people are, as a whole, generous. According to our centre’s Doing Good Index, donations from individuals account for 32 per cent of the budgets of charities in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The city’s system for supporting higher education is among the most sophisticated in the world. When the government set up a donation-matching scheme for universities in 2003, funds flowed in, with institutions recording a 100-fold increase in donations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong is also home to the Jockey Club Charitable Trust, one of the world’s largest foundations in terms of annual donations, giving away on average HK$4 billion (US$513 million) each year.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/09/02/viet_thumbnail_copy1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">04:30</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">The Hong Kong restaurant offering free ‘fortune meals’ to the needy, seven days a week</p><p>The Hong Kong restaurant offering free ‘fortune meals’ to the needy, seven days a week</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The third reason Hong Kong stands to become a regional philanthropic hub is its connectivity to the world. While it is true that at the moment, we feel somewhat cut off, this was not the case before the pandemic, and will not be the case after. Hong Kong remains a hub for multinational companies and global financial institutions. The Hong Kong stock exchange is the world’s largest bourse in terms of market capitalisation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And it isn’t just business that connects Hong Kong to the world. Many global universities have offices here, with schools from MIT to Oxford carving out opportunities for partnerships and regional bases in the city.</p>Finally, Hong Kong remains the primary gateway to China, the economy that has produced more <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">billionaires</span></a> than any other in the world. Our research shows that the country’s elite were engaged in philanthropy even before President Xi Jinping’s calls for “<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">common prosperity</span></a>”, which will undoubtedly propel this investment further.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/09/02/viet_thumbnail_copy1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China’s Blue Book on Philanthropy reports that Chinese foundations tripled over a six-year period, from 3,000 in 2012 to over 8,000 in 2019. In our discussions with Chinese philanthropists, the notion of giving back is voiced again and again.</p>As <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Cao Dewang</span></a>, CEO of Fuyao Glass and one of China’s richest men, said: “In Chinese culture, we are imbued with the reciprocity mindset. You have to bear social responsibility while you make money. When the gap between the rich and the poor further widens in our nation, we – as entrepreneurs – should stand up and take this responsibility.”<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">What are Hong Kong’s charities, businesses doing to help the needy?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Philanthropy is, by definition, driven by the private sector. Throughout Hong Kong’s history, the private sector has been front and centre in addressing social challenges. And while Hong Kong has a great deal of experience in philanthropy, it has also been a highly successful entrepôt for decades, imbuing Hong Kong with the understanding that there are numerous paths to success.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To be a philanthropy hub is to recognise that progress can be made through a range of strategies and models, some of which are still emerging. This ability to be responsive and innovative is the foundation of Hong Kong’s success to date.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These are the reasons we at the Centre for Asian Philanthropy and Society decided to base ourselves in Hong Kong, and are why this city remains the region’s natural philanthropy hub.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Ruth A Shapiro, PhD, is co-founder and CEO of The Centre for Asian Philanthropy and Society</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWefpbavtc6nZpqqpJ6wrbGObGhvbWhlg3C0zqeeZqOfo7RuvM6iqp6cXZeybq3SopisZaKatKq7zZqjZqiYnrmiutOhqaioqWK1tq4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
