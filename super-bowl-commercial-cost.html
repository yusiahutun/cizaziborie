In 2021, <a href=# rel=noopener>Super Bowl ads</a> took a hit due to the ongoing health crisis, as many big advertisers like Coke, Pepsi, and Budweiser pulled out from their regular ad spots.

In 2021, the cost of a Super Bowl commercial started at $5.5 million according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">AdWeek</a>. CBS originally opened the bidding at $5.6 million, but it took two months longer than usual for their ad slots to sell out—so it appears that some companies, like Scotts Miracle-Gro, may have secured a deal to save around $100,000. This about mirrored how much Super Bowl commercials cost in 2020. At the time, ads cost brands upwards of $5.6 million—but this was a jump from costs in 2019, when Super Bowl ads cost anywhere between $5.1 to $5.3 million.</p><p>As for 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Statista</a> reported that Super Bowl commercials cost advertisers $7 million for 30-second spots during the Super Bowl LVII broadcast. The site also cited a 2020 survey that found that 79 percent of Super Bowl viewers see the commercials as entertainment of their own right, while 71 percent reported that they enjoyed watching the commercials. Statista also reported that, during the 2019 Super Bowl, viewers spent 641 thousand hours watching Super Bowl commercials on YouTube, which was a 58 percent increase from the previous year.</p><p>“The fractionalization of attention because of streaming and social media makes the Super Bowl more important than ever,” Patrick Crakes, a former Fox Sports executive turned media consultant, told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">CNN Business</a> in 2022. “If you’re in business with the NFL and you’re advertising during the Super Bowl, you’re a real player.”</p><p>Crakes added that there also examples of the Super Bowl “helping build brands,” not just promoting them.&nbsp;“Think about a company like GoDaddy. GoDaddy invested in the Super Bowl for years, did a lot of crazy things to get attention inside it, and it helped their business,” he said. “I think it’s a great investment, even at this price tag.”</p><p>Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, told CNN Business that the total commercials for 2022 amounted almost $500 million in ad revenue. “You’re likely looking at about 70 ads, so you’re getting pretty close to $500 million in ad revenue from the game for NBC,” he said. “And that, by the way, is just during the game. That doesn’t count before the game, after the game and all of the other opportunities there are to run additional advertising.” He continued, “$500 million is a lot of money for anyone, but in the world of media, Super Bowl spots are in a whole other level. That is why the NFL is such a valuable sports franchise, because there’s this ability to charge advertisers this much to be on these events.”</p><p>Calkins added that there are also “two big benefits” for networks like NBC, FOX and CBS to being in business with the NFL and broadcast the Super Bowl. The main benefit is the commercial revenue, which “NBC will use this opportunity to support the rest of their lineup” in promotions during and after the Super Bowl. “For NBC, the Super Bowl is an event that they can use to jump-start the rest of their lineup as they go into the spring and the rest of the year,” he said. “A number of years ago, people said, ‘the Super Bowl is going to fade away. It’s getting unsustainable.’ It’s completely the reverse. The Super Bowl is more and more important because it’s a shared experience. And what’s interesting is a lot of people watching the Super Bowl don’t even really care about the game. They’re watching the ads.”</p><p>Paul Mirshak, who a professor sports marketing at Champlain College in Saint-Lambert, Quebec, told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">CBC</a> in 2022 about why sports events like the Super Bowl is so valuable. “Sports is one of the few things on television where people actually watch live,” he said. He added that, while viewers now often stream their favorite television shows and don’t see traditional commercials, “the Super Bowl is an exception.” Peter Widdis, a professor in marketing and innovation at George Brown College in Toronto, Ontario, agreed. “You know that you’re going to reach an audience of 100 million people that are likely not going to click and change [the channel],” Widdis told CBC. Mirshak also added of the value of investing in a Super Bowl commercial “Yes, it costs $6 million for 30 seconds of your time. But when you factor in the large audience of about 100 million people watching this game, and when you do the calculation … it’s actually pretty good value,” he said.</p><p>He cited the 1984 Super Bowl, when Apple introduced the Macintosh (now known as the Mac) computer. “After the Super Bowl aired, they couldn’t keep computers on store shelves,” Mirshak said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/super-bowl-book.jpeg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$16.59+</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$29.95</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>45% Off</span></p><p>For more about the Super Bowl, football fans can check out <a data-pmc-sp-product=53d1db0529f18ff6311aa0fe97247319 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl","price":"24.87","id":"1589799208","category":"State & Local"},"id":1190837,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl</a> by Harvey Frommer. The best-selling book delves into the history of the first Super Bowl, which was originally known as the AFL-NFL Championship Game. (The term “Super Bowl” was coined only in its third year.) The debut game, between the winning Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs, was played in front of only 61,946 people at&nbsp;the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum—an audience well&nbsp;below the stadium’s capacity. Harvey Frommer, a sports historian and reporter, puts the tale of that momentous game together using oral history, gathered by hundreds of interviews with players, coaches, media and spectators alike.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
