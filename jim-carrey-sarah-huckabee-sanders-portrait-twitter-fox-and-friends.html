It is not Christian-like whatsoever," she continued. "I think it's a moment for us as conservatives to just look better, take the upper hand, and to say, you know what, you can keep leveling these attacks against us, but we're not responding to it with the exact same ugliness because we have more to offer, more education, better comments. We can argue with logic. We don't need to argue with ad hominem attacks all the time."</p><p>(Apparently, Owens has never seen <strong><a href=#>President Donald Trump's</a></strong> Twitter feed.)</p><p>Earhardt then showed Fox viewers another one of Carrey's paintings, which he said "offers an expression of love and appreciation to womankind," then teed up her guest to dig in on liberal "hypocrisy."</p><p>"They celebrate women, only if women think exactly like they do," Owens said. "That is, again, always what we see on the left. You have to subscribe to exactly what they think or else you will get attacked. Hypocrisy, hypocrisy is thy name."</p><p>Carrey previously pissed off Fox News and conservatives in 2013 when he teamed up with <strong><a href=#>Funny or Die</a></strong> for NRA parody music video "Cold Dead Hands," in which he impersonated Charleston Heston, an actor who was once the president of the National Rifle Association.</p><p>See Carrey's tweet below, followed by a mixture of outrage, praise, jokes and a staunch defense from comedian Kathy Griffin.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is the portrait of a so-called Christian whose only purpose in life is to lie for the wicked.
