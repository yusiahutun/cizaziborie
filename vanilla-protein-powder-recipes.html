They’re quick, delicious and easy to pack full of nutrients our bodies need. But if you’d like to add a little variety to your morning routine, and you want to get the most out of that expensive jug of vanilla protein powder, we have good news. There are several tasty and convenient vanilla protein powder recipes that aren’t smoothies. That’s right — you can get your protein by eating pancakes, banana bread or even carrot cake. Keep reading to see what dietitians and nutritionists say about baking with vanilla protein powder and to check out some of our favorite recipes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Benefits of adding vanilla protein powder to recipes</h2><p>Adding vanilla protein powder to baked good recipes is a delicious and convenient way to hit your health targets in a variety of ways, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Omaira Ferreira, FDN-P, HHP</a>, founder of Ferreira Functional Health. She notes that some of the top benefits of boosting the protein content of your recipes are:</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><li><strong>Muscle recovery and growth:</strong> “Adding vanilla protein powder to recipes can help provide the amino acids needed to support muscle recovery after workouts and promote muscle building.”</li><li><strong>Nutrient density: </strong>“Protein powders often contain additional nutrients such as vitamins, minerals and sometimes fiber.”</li><li><strong>Weight management:</strong> “Protein is known to increase satiety and help regulate appetite, making you feel fuller for longer.” And that can help you lose weight.

There are both plant-based and dairy options. However, the world of protein powders is a vast one, so we asked <a href=#>Susan Van Raes</a>, functional nutritionist, food psychology specialist and founder of Boulder Nutrition, how she picks her favorite.</p><p>“I have done so much research on protein powders over the years, and my favorites are those that are clean, have low-glycemic sweeteners and pure ingredients,” she says. Among her favorites: Ancient Nutrition Vanilla Plant Protein (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Ancient Nutrition, $38.21)</a> as a dairy- free option, and for those who can tolerate dairy, IsaLean by IsaGenix (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from IsaGenix, $52</a>).

Keep goodies tender with extra liquid.</h3><p>While adding vanilla protein powder to recipes packs on nutritional value, it can also change the texture of the finished product. “It can make recipes denser, drier or more crumbly,” says Ferreira. “To counteract this, you can try adding additional liquid ingredients or adjusting the overall recipe to ensure a moist and tender texture.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Watch your sugar.</h3><p>Because vanilla protein powder is already sweet, you should be careful when adding it to recipes so as not to over-sweeten. “There are some protein powders that have added sugar, honey or artificial sweeteners,” says <a href=#>Catherine Gervacio, RDN</a>, Certified Exercise Nutrition Coach at <a href=#>Health Cana</a>. “Therefore, it’s best to adjust the taste of a recipe and consider adjusting the levels of other ingredients, especially when making desserts.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Pick this powder for high-heat baking.</h3><p>Since the most popular way to consume vanilla protein powder is in smoothies and shakes, you might wonder whether or not baking it impacts its nutritional content. While heat can potentially alter the bioavailability and digestibility or protein powder, it isn’t likely to happen while baking, reassures Ferreira. “The impact of baking on nutritional value is generally minimal unless the protein powder is subjected to very high temperatures for a long time.”</p><p>“It’s worth noting that different protein powders have different heat stability levels,” she adds. “For example, whey protein isolate tends to be more heat-stable compared to plant-based protein powders like pea or hemp protein.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Vanilla protein powder recipes that aren’t smoothies</h2><p>Good news: You actually can have your cake and eat it too. By adding vanilla protein powder to these tasty breakfast and dessert treats, you’re satisfying your sweet tooth and your hunger in a healthy way.
