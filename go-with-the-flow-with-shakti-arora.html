It is a time consuming occupation, and being an influencer also comes with having to deal with people’s prejudice towards your job. Even though there are many more elements to being an influencer than just posting aesthetically pleasing & strategically planned content, some people still find it hard to believe that influencers are working hard, or at all.</span></p><p><span>Today we have a name under our spotlight that breaks down these prejudices toward being an influencer: Influencer and actor Shakti Arora. Shakti is a well known Indian actor, and he has been acting on several TV shows since 2006. Besides winning the Best Actor awards in Kalakar Awards in 2015, he is also the owner of the title of Youth Icon of the year. As the icon he is, Shakti inspires his 2.5M fans to follow their passions, and go with the flow of their lives.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We had a little interview with Shakti about his life juggling between two professions, his future plans, and his inspirations.</span></p><p><b>You are both an actor and a travel influencer at the same time. Have you ever had clashing schedules? Did you postpone a trip due to a shoot or missed a shoot because you were traveling?</b></p><p><span>I feel God is waiting for me to travel and when I do that, a work opportunity falls into my lap… So till now I have postponed many shoots…</span></p><p><b>How do you feel about having such a big audience? Does it feel overwhelming at times?</b></p><p><span>Audience is due to the shows I have done, and it increased more since I started traveling. And yes it’s overwhelming as well.</span></p><p><b>If you had to choose one career only, would it be acting or being an influencer?</b></p><p><span>Acting is my first love. Traveling is my passion. Being an influencer was a fluke. So I would have gone with the flow.</span></p><p><b>Are there any mistakes you wish you hadn’t made in either of your careers?</b></p><p><span>I haven’t done any mistake but God has, by creating the coronavirus and putting a halt on our all travel plans.</span></p><p><b>What does the future hold for you? What are your plans in terms of your career path?</b></p><p><span>In terms of my career I am busy with ad shoots, music videos and brand endorsements on social media too. I intend to be a part of web series/films in future.</span></p><p><b>Who are your inspirations on social media?</b></p><p><span><a href=# rel=noopener>Magic Fox</a> is very good with his page on Instagram. I like his style and the photos/presets that he uses. So basically he inspires me to be better.</span></p><p><strong>Follow Shakti on <a href=# rel=noopener>his social media</a> for more of his travels & content when all the COVID craziness is over, and who knows, maybe you see him with us on our next adventure!
