It’s definitely up in the air.Producer of all four films Sherri Singer revealed to E! in a past interview that she would totally want to make the fifth movie happen. “I’d have to get Disney Channel to get on-board, but I would like to [make],” Singer said. “I have ideas of how I would do it. There was some talk about it a year and a half ago, but then it didn’t happen.”</p><p>Other than a reboot or another sequel, Halloweentown fans will be delighted to know that two of the original cast members are engaged! Kimberly J. Brown who starred as Marnie in the first three movies and Daniel Kountz who starred as Kalabar’s son Kal in Halloween 2: Kalabar’s Revenge&nbsp;announced their engagement on June 30, 2022 after they started their relationship in 2018. The two reunited for Kimberly’s comedy sketch YouTube series and reconnected. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2022, &nbsp;Kimberly gushed about how the two hit it off almost 20 years after the original film. “So, we first met, 20 years ago filming a movie together, where our characters flirted a little bit in the beginning but then I found out that he was my family’s arch nemesis and basically hated him, for the rest of the movie,” she said. “In real life, we had no romantic feelings for each other at all while we were working together and then didn’t see or talk to each other for, like, at least a good 10 years or so,” she added. “Then reconnected a few years ago to film some comedy sketches for my YouTube channel and unexpectedly fell in love. So it’s funny how life surprises you sometimes.”</p><p>The two also shared their thoughts on a possible reboot featuring their characters to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">J-14</a> in 2022.&nbsp;“I think there’s a ton of possibilities if they ever decided to go down that road again,” Kimberly explained. “Marnie could be doing something in Halloweentown, either training the next generation or running for mayor. Marnie always liked to push the town and push people forward and come up with new ideas. I always loved that about her. She was so adventurous and courageous.” Daniel, who is now a realtor, also added that he would love to rejoin the cast. “[I] definitely want to come back and get his revenge, because so many fans have pointed out over the years it was kind of open-ended the way he flew off in a bout of baddie rage,” he said. “Kal reformed, came back and apologized. He’s still got that bad streak in him, but it’s not as bad as it was back then.”</p>With the long-awaited sequel <a href=# rel=noopener>Hocus Pocus 2</a> now&nbsp;on Disney+ more than 20 years after the original release, many fans of the spooky season are super eager for the potential of a fifth Halloweentown movie.<p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Halloweentown</a> is available to stream on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Disney Plus</a>.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
