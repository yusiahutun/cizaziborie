So it seems like it was love at first sight. But, unfortunately, of all the boxer’s marriages, the one with Sonji was the shortest as it lasted around 2 years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/056aed0e13bc2a47.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Maria Aquinar: What you should know about Sebastian Bach's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Both have passed on, Sonji passing away at her home from a heart attack in 2005.

Everyone has been wondering about Sonji’s life after divorcing the legendary boxer. Of course, little is known about her early life or anything before her marriage to Muhammad Ali, but the good thing is that she entered the limelight after getting involved with the boxers. And her life has some interesting revelations.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/50e0b680460509ae.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fadi Fawaz: net worth, George Michael relationship, latest updates</span></p></a><h3>1. Muhammad Ali proposed the night they met</h3><p class=align-left>Sonji and Muhammad Ali met in 1964, the same year that the legendary boxer won his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first heavyweight championship</a>. During this time, Sonji Roi was a cocktail waitress. Also, Ali was 22 years old, while Sonji was only 18.</p><p class=align-left>It was love at first sight for the two, and it did not take long for Muhammad to propose to Sonji. Their first date turned into an engagement night as Muhammad proposed to Sonji. They married in Gary, Indiana, on August 14, 1964. Roi and Muhammad Ali reportedly met through Ali's manager, Herbert Muhammad.</p><h3>2. She was also known as Sonji Clay</h3><p class=align-left>When Sonji met Muhammad Ali, he had not yet converted to Muslim and took the boxer’s surname. Then, Muhammad Ali was named Cassius Marcellus Clay, and until her divorce, Sonji was addressed as Sonji Clay.</p><h3>3. Her marriage to Muhammad Ali was short</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/116c74ae49a7fa1d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nadji Jeter: girlfriend, family, nationality, awards, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The most unfortunate thing for fans that rooted for Muhammad and Sonji’s marriage is it was short-lived. They were married in 1964 and divorced in January 1966, making the marriage relatively short.</p><p class=align-left>Many would even equate the <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">short marriage</a> to the haste they took while marrying, which happened quite fast. Also, it is essential to note that Muhammad and Sonji never had children together.</p><h3>4. Islam was the primary reason for her divorce</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/056aed0e13bc2a47.jpg><p class=align-left>You are likely wondering about the primary reason for Muhammad Ali and Sonji’s separation. At the time of their marriage in 1964, Muhammad Ali wasn’t into Islam as he later was. And it seems his gradual conversion to the religion caused a great rift in their relationship.</p><p class=align-left>Sonji felt that religion affected Muhammad's mind. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Telegraph reported</a> Sonji stating:</p>I wasn’t going to take on all the Muslims. If I had, I probably would have ended up dead.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryan Callen: divorce story, wife, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She felt brainwashed to accept the Muslim way of living, including the dress code, customs and adopting the culture in her marriage to Muhammad Ali.</p><h3>5. Both Sonji and Ali have passed away</h3><p class=align-left>Sonji and Muhammad Ali are both gone. Muhammad's story is public, including his struggle with Parkinson's disease. On June 3, 2016, he died after being hospitalized for respiratory issues. However, his death came after more than a decade of his ex-wife's.</p><p class=align-left>What happened to Sonji Roi? Sonji died on October 11, 2005, of natural causes. However, Clay-Glover's nephew believed that she might have suffered from a heart attack. Instead, she was found dead in her home.</p><p class=align-left>How old was Sonji Roi when she died? At her death, early Tuesday morning in her Hyde Park home in Chicago's South Side, Roi was 64 years old.</p><h3>6. Sonji was a singer, model, and waitress.</h3><p class=align-left>Earlier in her life and when she met Muhammad Ali for the first time, Sonji worked as a cocktail waitress. However, after her separation from the boxer, she launched a <a href=#>singing career</a>, even though it was short-lived. She gained popularity from <i>Here I Am</i> and <i>Here I Stay records</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79906f3403a94856.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cynthia Morgan biography: boyfriend, sickness, net worth, what happened, latest pictures</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Sonji also recorded <a href=#>another single</a> for Aries Record Productions, <i>I Can’t Wait</i> (<i>Until I See My Baby’s Face</i>). Sonji also did some modelling work.</p><h3>7. Her second marriage was to Reynold Glover</h3><p class=align-left>After separating from the boxer, Sonji Roi moved to Chicago from Miami. Here, she met Reynaldo Glover, a corporate lawyer and <a href=#>business</a> advisor. He was also a one-time board chairman of the City Colleges of Chicago. Also, Reynaldo served as the firm's president, selling remnants of Beatrice International Food Co.</p><p class=align-left>They had one child together, a son named Brian Renaldo Jr. Sonji also went ahead to have Herman Griffin, but the father wasn't Reynaldo.</p><p class=align-left>Reynaldo and Sonji later separated, and she never remarried. Glover remarried and had three more children – two sons and a daughter – Ryan, Jharett, Shea and a grandson. Unfortunately, he died of complications from pancreatic cancer on November 27, 2007.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6386279f0a3e462e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder relationship explained</span></p></a><h3>8. Sonji had two children</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/50e0b680460509ae.jpeg><p class=align-left>Did Sonji Roi have children? Muhammad Ali’s ex-wife didn’t have children with <a href=#>the boxer</a>, but she had children in her other <a href=#>relationships</a>.</p><p class=align-left>As mentioned earlier, she had Brian Reynaldo Jr in her marriage with Reynaldo. Also, she had Herman Griffin during the same period, though Reynaldo is not the father.</p><p class=align-left>The public has always wondered about Sonji Roi and Herman Griffin. Since it is not Sonji’s second husband, Reynaldo, who is the father? Herman has kept his life under wraps, and nothing is known about him aside from being the son of Sonji. And so far, there hasn’t been any revelation about his father.</p><h3>9. Sonji was a strong, independent woman</h3><p class=align-left>Close friends have described Sonji Roi as a strong independent woman. She always wanted to be herself and was a highly spirited woman. And that is why she didn't conform to Muhamad Ali's conversion to Muslim, which meant that she would also follow suit. So it was a great source of contention being an independent woman.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2dcf76ce0030497a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mike Wolfe wife, daughter, family, house, net worth</span></p></a><h3>10. No autopsy was conducted on her body</h3><p class=align-left>Sonji was found dead in her home, and it was generally believed that she died of natural causes. Therefore, no autopsy was conducted on her body.</p><p class=align-left>Sonji Roi, Muhammad Ali's ex-wife, was a high-spirited woman many people have been wondering about. After her separation from Muhammad Ali, she built another life and even had children. Sonji’s death in 2005 of natural causes was quite unfortunate and a great shock to her <a href=#>family</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Are you looking for more information about Emani Richardson? <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> featured an <a href=#>interesting article</a> about Erica Dixon's daughter that made an excellent mother-daughter duo on the red carpet at the 23rd Annual Trumpet Awards in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p class=align-left>Emani is mainly recognized through her mother, who has a great career in the movie industry as an actress and reality TV personality.
