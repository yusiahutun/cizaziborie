  Embracing the warm weather over the weekend, the singer-slash-actress wore a backless yellow-and-brown-striped midi dress with side cutouts and spaghetti straps, and teamed it with a pair of coordinating woven espadrille wedges."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And just like her oversized gold hoops and gold-tinted aviator sunglasses (which she also put on for the daytime outing), the wedge has quickly become a J.Lo style signature. She's been wearing the clunky sandal for years — and every summer, just like clockwork, she pulls them out of her closet to wear for another season.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lopez rounded out her summertime look with a brown leather Saint Laurent chain-strapped shoulder bag and an effortless updo that was complemented by her wispy curtain bangs.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ben, for his part, coordinated with his wife in a beige button-down, blue jeans, brown sneakers, and his own pair of aviator shades.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bennifer's family outing came just days after Lopez revealed that her kids have a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"difficult" time</a> with having famous parents. “Being the child of famous parents is really not something that many people can understand, and I feel for [my kids] ... because they didn’t choose that,” J.Lo said of her twins, whom she shares with her ex-husband Marc Anthony, during a recent roundtable discussion. “They have just started letting me know how people treat them. When they walk into the room, that’s what people are thinking about; they’re not seeing them for who they are. And I think that that has to be a really hard thing for them.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that her children find it “difficult to grow up and be themselves,” because they know the world is watching their every move. “They know that there’s a lens on them, and that’s hard. Probably not [a] very relatable thing to say, because a lot people don’t understand,” she said, before woefully admitting, "I did that to them."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yZ6lp6GWmr9uuM6pnLNlk6rBsMHTZpurnaOoerixw6CcZquRo7GiuNJmbm5oYG2FdQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
