Why? Because it’s an ancient grain full of nutrients that can help you lose weight, boost your liver health and lower cholesterol levels. Incorporating Kamut into your daily diet is simple, especially if you buy it as a flour to mix into batters, sauces and stews. The best part about Kamut flour? It boasts a rich flavor that beats the taste of regular flour. Keep reading to learn about the benefits of this Kamut flour and delicious ideas for using it in meals.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Kamut flour?</h2><p>This type of flour comes from <a href=#>ancient grain</a> called <a href=# rel=noopener>Khorasan wheat</a>, better&nbsp;known as Kamut. Pastry chef&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Norah Clark</a> notes that Kamut is “thought to have originated in Egypt and is now grown organically&nbsp;in various regions worldwide.” To make Kamut flour, the grain’s wheat berries are milled until they resemble fine, powdery texture.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How is Kamut flour different from all-purpose flour?</h2><p>Both types of flour are made with wheat grains, but Kamut flour isn’t refined or bleached like the all-purpose kind is. Although this unrefined quality gives Kamut flour a denser texture than regular flour, it also makes it more nutritious. What’s more, the flavor of Kamut flour is rich, nutty and buttery unlike the bland taste of all-purpose flour.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the health benefits of Kamut&nbsp;flour?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Chrissy Arsenault, MBA, RDN</a>, registered dietitian at <a href=# rel=noopener>AthleticMuscle.com</a>, notes that about ¾ cup of Kamut flour contains 337 calories, 71 grams of carbohydrates and nearly 15 grams of protein. That’s 67% more protein than in the same serving of all-purpose flour. Additionally, the benefits of consuming this ancient grain are well-documented in multiple studies:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It’s associated with improving cholesterol and blood sugar levels</h3><p>In 2015, research published in journal Nutrients found that participants showed significant improvement in their <a href=# rel=noopener>overall cholesterol, plus better glucose and insulin levels</a>, after adding Kamut to their diet for an eight-week period. The grain also helped reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which is especially good news when it comes to keeping our hearts strong.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It helps ward off fatty liver disease</h3><p>Another study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition had patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease swap their usual grains — pasta, bread and crackers — with Kamut-based products over a three-month period. Even though it was a short period of time, the patients all showed <a href=# rel=noopener>significant improvement in liver function</a> with the simple switch.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It speeds fat loss and reduces the risk of diabetes</h3><p>A 2019 study from the European Journal of Nutrition made a compelling case for Kamut’s ability to help shed pounds and reduce risk of type 2 diabetes. Like the liver study, participants replaced all of their usual grain products with Kamut-based options. After four months, they had <a href=# rel=noopener>lowered their fat mass and increased their levels of DHA, </a>an omega-3 fatty acid that boosts brain function.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How can I use Kamut flour in dishes?</h2><p>Brands of Kamut flour, including Organic KAMUT Khorasan Wheat Flour (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Walmart, $11.99</a>), are available in stores and online.
