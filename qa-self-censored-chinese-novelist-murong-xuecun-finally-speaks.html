Famed for his 2002 debut novel, , which sold a million copies and was longlisted for the 2008 Man Asian Literary Prize, Murong is one of the best-known authors on the mainland.
An influential online social critic, he had 8.5 million followers on his Weibo microblog accounts before they were forcibly closed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"It's difficult to describe the feeling - it's a bit like a child who had a sweet snatched away from him."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His pent-up frustrations exploded one day. In 2010, he wrote an impassioned and candid speech on the devastating censorship faced by mainland authors. He planned to deliver it at the People's Literature Prize ceremony, where he was to collect an award for his book, about his time spent undercover inside an illegal pyramid scheme.</p><a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2015/07/11/669c2cb26852d6ad6e33a7b3a83f086d.jpg></span></a>He was barred from delivering the speech, but he posted it online, where it went viral. He delivered the speech in Hong Kong in 2011. "We cannot criticise the system, we cannot discuss current affairs ... sometimes I can't help but wonder, is the Cultural Revolution really over?" he said in the speech.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Murong said that speech was a watershed. In the years that followed, he became increasingly bold - in speaking in defiance of the authorities or taking parts in activism.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In late 2011, he tried to visit detained blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng in his village. Last year, after several participants in a private commemoration of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown got detained, he wrote an open letter inviting the authorities to arrest him because his speech was read out in the meeting in his absence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After he returned from Australia, he was detained by police for eight hours. In May this year, he joined a protest in front of the New York Public Library to protest against the limits on free speech in China and later, also in the US, he joined in a commemoration of the 26th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His boldness has exacted a heavy price - in the past couple of years, the popular author has found himself contacted less and less by mainland publishers and newspapers. His four Weibo, or microblog accounts, followed by 8.5 million people, were shut down without any explanation given. Just this week, another of his popular Weibo accounts was shut down.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Murong believes he is a victim of the overall ideological tightening across the country since 2013. The Communist Party promulgated Document No 9 that year, which ordered cadres in charge of ideology and propaganda to tackle seven subversive influences in society, including dangerous liberal ideas such as human rights and press freedom.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His transformation from a popular author to persona non grata within the worlds of publishing and media had been tough, Murong said, but he had simply grown tired of self-censorship. Now, he would rather speak his mind and lose his market and income than to compromise his integrity, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"To an author, this is a very difficult choice. I was an author of best sellers: I could have lived comfortably. But in a country like this, all sorts of opportunities have been denied of me."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Murong is currently writing a futuristic novel about China in 2072, which he has temporarily named . This time, he has not tiptoed around political issues although he believes it will not be allowed to be published in China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over the years, he has seen many friends of his own age, who started out as mild critics of the government, becoming increasingly vocal and ending up in prison or escaping abroad. He said he was also often gripped by a sense of fear, while the threat of prison was never far from his mind.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"It's as if there is an abyss in front of you that you can't see … and every step you take is full of fear and uncertainty," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Murong said he believed he would "almost certainly" end up in detention or jail, but this would not deter him from speaking up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"If I don't say anything and shut up, would I feel better? I don't think so," he said. "So I don't think about [being arrested], I only think about whether I should say something or not.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"If you live in a country where no one has the courage to speak ... in some ways, you're in prison already."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With less and less space for liberal writers like himself in China, Murong has to publish his works abroad. Before his Weibo account was shut down this week, he wrote: "The wok I've relied on for food has been smashed into pieces - I have no choice but to beg for food outside."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, he said he was not keen on living abroad either, even though his works had been translated into English, French, German, Portuguese and Vietnamese and he often travelled to the US and Europe to give talks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"My English is not great, [so] if I leave behind the place I'm so familiar with, it's also like being in a prison," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I don't want to leave, but I don't want to shut up either... I hope I can contribute towards the democratic reform of China."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Living under an authoritarian regime, Murong said he understood why many people would be afraid of criticising the government, but he warned that compromising one's conscience would have dangerous consequences. "It's not a game that you can stop any time, it's a moral downward spiral," he posted in a Weibo message shortly before his account was closed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Today, you don't mind shaking hands with the devil. Tomorrow, you won't mind embracing him. Then the day after, you might even speak on his behalf."</p><p datatype="p" class="tagline e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>&nbsp;</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Self-censored writer finally speaks his mind</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0u8KinK2xX5a%2FtbXCpZxoaWhohHN%2BlmiommWjmrmnecKepaynopqxbq%2FHoqWeq5Viu7DCxKWgrKxdosKzu82gZLGtlZjCr3nFoqWapJyuerS8xJqirA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
