The company has been working on bringing DirectX 12 support to macOS for almost two years, and it is expected to be finally available in the summer of 2023.</p><p>Gaming enthusiasts who use CrossOver to <a href=#>run Windows games on a Mac</a> will benefit from DirectX 12, which offers better performance and speed. The current version of CrossOver uses DirectX 11, which Microsoft unveiled way back in 2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For those who are unaware, <a href=#>DirectX</a> is a collection of APIs that deal with game programming and graphics on Microsoft platforms, including Windows and Xbox. And the latest version, DirectX 12, was initially launched alongside Windows 10 in 2015.</p><h2 id=how-crossover-39-s-directx-12-support-will-impact-gaming-on-the-mac>How CrossOver's DirectX 12 Support Will Impact Gaming on the Mac</h2><p>As we mentioned, native gaming options for Mac are not in the best condition. Even though some believe <a href=#>Apple silicon is the future of Mac gaming</a>, macOS is not yet the go-to option when you need a variety of titles to play. However, CrossOver's introduction of DirectX 12 to macOS can create a worthwhile middle ground here.</p><h3 id=noticeable-improvement-in-speed-and-stability>Noticeable Improvement in Speed and Stability</h3><p>As you may have noticed, DirectX 12 is a substantial improvement from the previous version, DirectX 11. According to many tests, DirectX 12 is 50-70% more efficient in terms of rendering speed and power consumption.</p><p>Therefore, these improvements would be beneficial when you want to play a heavy-duty Windows game on your Mac using CrossOver 23.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=native-support-for-apple-silicon-macs>Native Support for Apple Silicon Macs</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-Silicon-Mac-M2-Chip.jpg><p>CrossOver for Mac has had Apple silicon support for quite some time. In fact, the screenshot CodeWeavers have published on their blog post talking about the DirectX 12 upgrade is of an M2-powered Mac running Diablo II: Resurrected.</p><p>Therefore, you can expect the games you run using CrossOver 23 to make the best use of both CPU and GPU resources. And the best part? Running games using a compatibility layer like CrossOver is far <a href=#>more resource-efficient than virtual machine software</a> like VMWare and Parallels Desktop.</p><p>So, instead of waiting for game developers to release the Apple silicon-optimized version, you can use the CrossOver 23 compatibility layer to play the Windows version of the game on your MacBook Pro, Mac Studio, Mac mini, or iMac.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=potential-limitations>Potential Limitations</h3><p>It's worth noting that CrossOver 23 will not enable DirectX 12 support for all Windows games from the start. Instead, the developer has said, a per-title method will be used. The first game to run on Mac using DirectX 12 support will be Diablo II: Resurrected. The company will keep adding DirectX support to more games over time, and you can keep track of the updates through the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeWeavers blog</a>.</p><p>Therefore, while the news is exciting, you need to have a lot of patience before you play your favorite AAA games on a Mac using CrossOver. But if you love Diablo II: Resurrected, you can check it out when CodeWeavers releases the first beta version of CrossOver 23 in the summer of 2023. But we expect the developers to release a more stable version sometime later this year.</p><h2 id=the-future-of-mac-gaming-looks-bright>The Future of Mac Gaming Looks Bright</h2><p>At this point, we feel impressed by the fact that you have multiple options to play games on a Mac. While we look forward to the upcoming Mac-optimized games, it is great that you do not have to wait for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, you should decide which is the best way to run Windows games on your Mac. For instance, if you also want to run Windows apps on your Mac, you may opt for Parallels Desktop instead of CrossOver.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiaq6ejqLy3sdFmm6KqlZjBuXmQa2SsraClvLPAjJ%2Bsra2imnqwsoymmJxll5a6qrrGaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
