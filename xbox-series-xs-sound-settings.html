Customize Your Audio Settings</h2><p>One of the <a href=#>first things you should do when you get your Xbox Series X|S</a> is adjust the audio settings, so you can ensure you're getting the sound quality that is right for you. All the options in both the <strong>Headset audio</strong> and <strong>Speaker audio</strong> settings are situational and can be tweaked to suit your accompanying devices.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/feature-51.jpg><p>You can tinker with your audio settings by opening your <strong>Settings</strong>, selecting <strong>General</strong>, and heading to <strong>Volume & audio output</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=speaker-audio-settings>Speaker Audio Settings</h3><p>If you are just listening to the sound through your TV speakers, set your sound to <strong>Stereo uncompressed.</strong> If you have a surround sound system, you will want to select either the <strong>5.1 uncompressed</strong> or <strong>7.1 uncompressed</strong> setting depending on your system's capabilities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/general-volume-and-audio-output-settings-on-xbox-series-xs-2.jpg><p>The <strong>Dolby Digital</strong>, <strong>Dolby Atmos for home theater (HDMI only)</strong>, and the <strong>DTS:X for home theater</strong><strong>(HDMI only) </strong>settings are for specific audio systems. Unless you have any of them, you’re better off ignoring these settings.</p><h3 id=headset-audio-settings>Headset Audio Settings</h3><p>When you first connect your headset to your console or plug it into the controller for the first time, it will be automatically set to <strong>Stereo uncompressed</strong>. This setting doesn't offer 3D or spatial sound.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/headset-audio-settings-on-xbox-series-xs-1.jpg><p><strong>Windows Sonic for Headphones</strong> is the console’s built-in 3D sound setting and will work on any headset. This is the setting you will want to opt for unless you have a Dolby Atmos subscription or DTS:X, of course.</p><h2 id=utilize-spacial-sound-with-dolby-atmos>2. Utilize Spacial Sound With Dolby Atmos</h2><p>If you have already been playing around with your sound settings, but none of the default options are hitting the mark, you could consider upgrading to Dolby Atmos to utilize those settings on your Xbox. Dolby Atmos focuses on developing high-tech 360-degree spatial sound technology, but it does come at a cost.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/man-losing-a-match-screaming-into-his-headset.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To utilize Dolby Atmos, you will need to sign up and pay a one-off purchase price of $14.99. This won’t be for everyone, of course, but being able to hear the exact direction that a sound is coming from can give you an edge in competitive multiplayer games. So if something like spatial sound is important to you, then gaining access to a service like Dolby Atmos is a surefire way to improve your sound experience.</p><h2 id=customize-your-headsets-audio-mixer>3. Customize Your Headsets Audio Mixer</h2><p>If something is bothering you about the sound on a compatible headset such as the Xbox Wireless Headset, it might be worth adjusting your levels in the <strong>Xbox Accessories App</strong>. These settings give you access to your headset's equalizer, so you have complete control over your sound.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/xbox-wireless-headset-settings-on-xbox-series-xs.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can also change turn the <strong>Bass boost</strong> on or off and select whether you would like incoming Bluetooth calls to lower the volume of your game or not.

Customize Your Chat Mixer</h2><p>Voice chat is one of the most interactive parts of gaming and is a great way to socialize with your friends. But it can be a little bit distracting sometimes, especially if you have that one guy in your friend group that gets a little too passionate while gaming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/general-additional-options-settings-to-customize-chat-mixer-on-xbox-series-xs.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Customizing your chat mixer gives you control over your voice chat volume, so you can lower it to hear the game clearer or turn it up if you want to be fully enveloped by your friend's banter.

Just open the <strong>Guide</strong>, scroll to <strong>Parties & chats</strong>, and select the <strong>Options</strong> menu to activate it. <strong>Noise suppression</strong> is one of the essential <a href=#>features that every Xbox Series X|S owner should be using</a>, particularly if you use voice chat a lot.</p><h2 id=your-xbox-will-sound-better-than-ever>Your Xbox Will Sound Better Than Ever</h2><p>Sound is one of the things that bring video games to life, so make sure you check your settings on your Xbox Series X|S to make sure they're as good as they can be.</p><p>If you’ve had an incredible surround sound system this whole time that's been underutilized, or have been listening to your friends crunching away on their mid-game snacks without noise suppression on, these audio settings could be lifesavers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGivm6eoYsCmvsieqmawo2LAsMHNnWSsnaSptq%2Bz0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
