Houtouwan, China</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some settlements lie deserted, not as a result of a calamitous event, but because the inhabitants chose to move elsewhere.</p>Located off the east coast of China, a ferry ride from Shanghai, Houtouwan, on Shengshan Island, was once a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">thriving fishing community</span></a>.

The final few, elderly, residents abandoned the village in the mid-1990s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, Houtouwan is a ghost town, but one with a new lease of life. The abandoned houses and narrow alleyways are veiled in vegetation, creating an otherworldly backdrop that attracts photographers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And the former villagers? An enterprising few return each day to sell bottles of water to tourists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/25/73a5649a-ece7-4ff6-bb46-d0105ea0eec0_a846676c.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">4. Kolmanskop, Namibia</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Founded in the early 20th century by German colonialists after the discovery of diamonds, Kolmanskop, in Namibia, grew rapidly as prospectors flocked to the area in the hope of striking it rich.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before long, a prosperous mining community was flourishing in the desert. By the 1950s, however, other, more lucrative operations with richer diamond deposits led to Kolmanskop’s demise.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once considered the richest town in Africa, Kolmanskop lies at the mercy of searing sunlight and sandstorms, its stark beauty enticing artists, filmmakers and Instagrammers keen to capture the acute sense of desolation. Visitor permits are required but are easy to obtain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/25/f9c46e6d-7e0e-4d98-b730-f6f7ff152251_761574a7.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">5. Stanford Training Area, Britain</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1942, the British Ministry of Defence gave the residents of seven neighbouring villages in Norfolk, England, one month to pack up and leave, as the district had been requisitioned for World War II military training.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The expulsion was intended to be temporary but the government broke its promise. After the war, the area became the Stanford Training Area and remains an infantry training facility.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The lost villages – West Tofts, Sturston, Langford, Buckenham Tofts, Stanford, Tottington and West Tofts Heath – can be visited on tours that run a dozen or so times a year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Each December, descendants of the exiled residents are invited to St Mary’s Church, West Tofts – one of four pre-war churches still standing – for a carol service.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">6. Roghudi Vecchio, Italy</h3>An estimated 6,000 <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">ghost villages</span></a> dot Italy’s landscape, each with its own story to tell.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the southern province of Reggio Calabria lies the abandoned hilltop settlement of Roghudi Vecchio, which dates back to the 11th century.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Situated in a picturesque valley in the Aspromonte Mountains, Roghudi Vecchio suffered from earthquakes, landslides and floods over the centuries until, in the early 1970s, the mayor pronounced the village uninhabitable and ordered it to be evacuated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, curious tourists explore the narrow cobblestone streets and crumbling stone houses, squint through the keyholes of derelict properties and marvel at how nature is reclaiming the medieval village.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/25/35d5602a-dffd-4ec1-8c67-dcce2664c125_15eb075d.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">7. Plymouth, Montserrat</h3>In 1997, Plymouth, Montserrat was destroyed in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a catastrophic volcanic eruption</span></a> that buried the Caribbean island’s capital city under metres of scalding mud and super­heated ash.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Plumes of smoke were propelled many kilometres into the air, prompting the evacuation of 5,000 residents. The southern half of the island was declared an exclusion zone and remains unsafe to visit, except on brief tours.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The derelict houses look much as they did on the day Plymouth was abandoned for good. Mid-90s Caribbean fashions fill bedroom wardrobes and furniture stands intact.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kitchen cupboards are still filled with jars of sauces and condiments that might have been used for dinner on that fateful evening – if someone had not knocked on the door and screamed at the inhabitants to run for their lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/25/9e59f409-bd44-4598-bf38-f09b375870ce_aeeec48b.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">8. Pripyat, Ukraine</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Perhaps the best known of all ghost towns, Pripyat was home to around 50,000 people until April 26, 1986, when reactor number four of the Chernobyl nuclear plant overheated and exploded.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Citizens were ordered to evacuate the Soviet (now Ukrainian) city – although first responders stayed at the scene, a decision that would cost most of them their lives.</p>Before February 2022, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">when Russia invaded Ukraine</span></a>, tours of the Chernobyl exclusion zone included creepy visits to Pripyat Middle School, the hospital, amusement park and forest where (highly radioactive) bears, deer, wolves and wild boar roam.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Protective hazmat clothing was not required as visitors were exposed to radiation levels no higher than a dental X-ray. Touching anything at the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster was a no-no, however, and tourists were checked for radioactive particles when they arrived and again when they left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/25/722cf8ed-f8ac-4f4f-a2a9-a8556845f195_5a796be0.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">9. So Lo Pun, Hong Kong</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Intrigued by haunting tales of solitude and sinister goings-on? The good news is you do not need to travel far to explore abandoned villages.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are estimated to be at least 100 scattered throughout Hong Kong. Some bustle with hikers and returning residents each weekend while others are significantly more spooky.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These are settlements where the term ghost village refers to a paranormal presence as much as a lack of inhabitants. So Lo Pun, in the northeast New Territories, ticks a number of supernatural boxes.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">5 Hong Kong ghost stories, from a haunted mahjong game to a spooky school</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is a derelict collection of moss-covered buildings with mildewing walls and broken windows located deep in a forest. Unexplained technical phenomena such as compass needles whirring erratically (So Lo Pun means “locked compass” in Cantonese) and the alleged absence of a mobile phone signal increase the eerie sense of unease.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rumoured disappearance of the entire population in a boat capsizing incident on a stormy night long ago adds to the legend, and most spine-chilling of all are the accounts of ghost sightings that an online “authority” swears are true.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Do not go alone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOramarpWhfKK%2B06KapZ1faH93fJJpaGhxXZy1sL%2FTZquor56oere10qKrZpuYnruiecCfqaKbkWLCrL7AoqWeZZGjsW60zqeeZqOfo7RuscSroJ5lopq6qrrDnqmsZaeWv26wyKyYrKyVp3qiusNmo6irow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
