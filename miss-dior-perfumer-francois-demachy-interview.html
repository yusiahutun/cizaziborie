The original incarnation of Miss Dior launched in 1947, decades before the subsequent successes of the now iconic J’Adore and Poison. The chypre fragrance, with top notes of gardenia, clary sage and bergamot has remained an integral part of the Parfums Christian Dior brand.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This year, the house of Dior worked with perfumer-creator Francois Demachy, who has been the nose at Dior since 2006, to re-imagine that original fragrance, which was inspired by the designer’s own sister, Catherine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here, Bazaar talks to Demachy about the latest incarnation…</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">In what ways does this update of Miss Dior still represent Catherine?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Miss Dior embodies ideal femininity, body and soul. Catherine Dior was Christian Dior's beloved sister who possessed a type of Parisian elegance that was simultaneously spontaneous, sassy, and refined. What she also had was great intelligence and immense courage. She was a great resistance fighter and was deported, which marked Christian Dior forever. This image of a strong and beautiful woman represents the foundations of Miss Dior."</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How do the new notes illustrate her strong character?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The opening is even livelier, bursting with assertive citrus notes. The floral heart is a sensual and potent duo of Grasse and Damascena Roses."</p><img alt="The original Miss Dior" title="The original Miss Dior" width=805 height=1207 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/original-miss-dior-1510052442.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Parfums Christian Dior</span><p>The original Miss Dior</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Who is the new Miss Dior Eau de Parfum?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She hasn't changed, as today's women claim their rightful place in the world. Miss Dior embodies Dior femininity, which as you can see, makes a lot of claims and even prints them on t-shirts!"</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Was it difficult reinventing a scent held so close to Christian Dior’s heart?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You have to keep going back to the basics: above all, Miss Dior is the perfume of love. It needs that spirit, that elegant radiance, and the instant sensuality that is its signature. Miss Dior is Christian Dior's first-born, his beloved daughter. Keeping that going stirs up a lot of questions and emotions. We have to stay true to his spirit but also reflect our own era."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How did you begin the process of rethinking Miss Dior?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don't need to go back to the archives as Miss Dior's story is with us all here at the House of Dior. My path was a sensorial one, and I had to find a certain lightness without losing the perfume's signature, by removing all the earthy notes and letting the flowers shine."</p><img alt="​The Château de la Colle Noire" title="​The Château de la Colle Noire" width=1331 height=887 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/la-colle-noir-1510052506.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Parfums Christian Dior</span><p>The Château de la Colle Noire</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">You went back to the gardens at La Colle Noir to reimagine Miss Dior - why was this?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You have to remember that Miss Dior is as much a Parisian as she is a Provençal girl. Christian Dior wrote as much with great lyricism, saying that Miss Dior was born on a summer's night in Provence – a warm night, when the nature that he so loved inspired his very first fragrance. The House of Dior has multiple, historical roots in Grasse. The Grasse region was a land of refuge for the Dior family in the 1930s and when Christian Dior became internationally successful, he still considered the area a paradise.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"La Colle Noire was a haven of peace for him. He was able to plant hectares of flowers, vines and trees, but above all, he planted entire fields of lavender, Jasmine, and of course, May Rose. Today, the Château de La Colle Noire has reopened its doors and we have replanted the May Rose, whose Absolute shines at the heart of Miss Dior EDP. We have come full circle, and I am convinced that Christian Dior would be delighted to see that his domain is once again a dazzling place of beauty, exchanges, and sharing, for that was his greatest wish."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-href="https://www.dior.com/beauty/en_gb/fragrance-beauty/fragrance/womens-fragrance/miss-dior/pr-missdiorfpl-y0082217_f008221709-eau-de-parfum.html?LGWCODE=F008221709GB;143909;6271&gclid=Cj0KCQiArYDQBRDoARIsAMR8s_T5Ie30NZH1lYo1nPFGQAQtoYwXkcIkT0yI0ucWvqDFMrfu_BfvwpgaAoX-EALw_wcB" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.dior.com/beauty/en_gb/fragrance-beauty/fragrance/womens-fragrance/miss-dior/pr-missdiorfpl-y0082217_f008221709-eau-de-parfum.html?LGWCODE=F008221709GB;143909;6271&gclid=Cj0KCQiArYDQBRDoARIsAMR8s_T5Ie30NZH1lYo1nPFGQAQtoYwXkcIkT0yI0ucWvqDFMrfu_BfvwpgaAoX-EALw_wcB" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Miss Dior Eau de Parfum" data-vars-ga-product-id=aa394450-687d-43bf-923c-082577f465ef data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-product-url="https://www.dior.com/beauty/en_gb/fragrance-beauty/fragrance/womens-fragrance/miss-dior/pr-missdiorfpl-y0082217_f008221709-eau-de-parfum.html?LGWCODE=F008221709GB;143909;6271&gclid=Cj0KCQiArYDQBRDoARIsAMR8s_T5Ie30NZH1lYo1nPFGQAQtoYwXkcIkT0yI0ucWvqDFMrfu_BfvwpgaAoX-EALw_wcB" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dior.com%2Fbeauty%2Fen_gb%2Ffragrance-beauty%2Ffragrance%2Fwomens-fragrance%2Fmiss-dior%2Fpr-missdiorfpl-y0082217_f008221709-eau-de-parfum.html%3FLGWCODE%3DF008221709GB%3B143909%3B6271%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiArYDQBRDoARIsAMR8s_T5Ie30NZH1lYo1nPFGQAQtoYwXkcIkT0yI0ucWvqDFMrfu_BfvwpgaAoX-EALw_wcB" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=02f082cc-58bf-4bd4-b9d6-2e00d1ef3d72 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Miss Dior Eau de Parfum</a>, £71.50 for 50ml, is out now</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX5u%2ForPRmqWcnV%2BWfnR%2Fkmlrb29fora0v4ydoKiqXaWys7LUppyrZZanrq%2BvzqKqZpyVoq6ktNhmoKeslafDqrHWaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
