She got famous in 2012 when she got signed by Mercury Records, then Island Def Jam.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Untitled-Design-40.jpg><p>Tracks like “Fancy” and “Work” officially ranked her as a star. However, she is also known for some of her controversial work on YouTube. Outside music, she is famous as a model, most notably for her work with Levi’s Jeans.</p><p>Among the variety of hats she wears, being a mother is the one Iggy seems to like the most. She has been known to pull out all the stops to protect her child.&nbsp;</p><p>Onyx is Iggy Azalea’s first and only child; however, many details about him are shrouded in mystery. A good example is his birth date.&nbsp;</p><p>It is speculated that Onyx Kelly was born at some point in mid-2020 (many speculate it happened in April) however his mother has never openly confirmed his birthday.&nbsp;</p><p>When she revealed news of his existence, she did so without pictures or details of his birth. Instead, she just proclaimed she had secretly welcomed a child, and that was it.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Iggy-Azalea-baby.jpg><p>The announcement was made via her Instagram stories on June 10, 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>She wrote:</p><p>“I have a son. I kept waiting for the right time to say something but it feels like the more time passes the more I realize I’m always going to feel anxious to share news that giant with the world.”&nbsp;</p><p>Iggy may have chosen not to share pictures of him, but she also made it clear that he was not her secret. According to her, she wanted to keep his life private but loved him very much.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Onyx_Kellys_Father></span>Who is Onyx Kelly’s Father?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Iggy had her son Onyx with none other than Jordan Terrell Carter, aka Playboi.&nbsp;</p><p>He is a famous rapper who caught his first wave of&nbsp; fame in 2017 thanks to hits like “Woke Up Like This” and “Magnolia.”&nbsp;</p><p>Like Iggy, he is also a model who has walked the runway for fashion giants like Louis Vuitton and VFiles.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems he is barely involved with his son, as Iggy once claimed to be a single mom. This was in October 2020 when she took to Instagram stories to confirm her separation from Playboi.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>wrote</a>,</p><p>“You lost a real one … people take loyalty for granted and that’s why I’d rather be alone… What I meant last night was that I’m raising my son alone and I am not in a relationship.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Times_The_Public_Has_Seen_Onyx_Kelly></span>Times The Public Has Seen Onyx Kelly&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>True to her word, Iggy had kept a lot about her son private. However, she once created an Instagram profile for him.&nbsp;</p><p>It did not end well. In mid-2021, she <a href=#>announced</a> on Twitter that she will not be sharing pictures of him anymore because of the many memes trolling him and some of his attires.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>wrote</a>:</p><p>“I’ve decided I won’t be posting about Onyx or sharing images online anymore. Y’all not about to be out here playing with my baby on my watch, nope!”</p><p>Despite her words, the proud mom has given in to the urge to showcase her son, blessing fans with pictures of him, but only on her platform.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Iggy-and-Onyx-Kelly.jpg><p>The first time the world got its first look at Onyx was after Iggy broke up with his father, Playboi, in October 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>The next time fans got to see the cute boy was in February 2021, when she shared a montage of never before seen pictures with him.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, it was not until his second birthday that she posted another photo of him, teasing her fans who have grown a soft spot for the cute boy.&nbsp;</p><p>Iggy, who was once in a <a href=#>feud</a> with Nicki Minaj, has hardly shared more of her son this year but her fans know she and the cute Onyx are somewhere living their best lives as mother and son.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktqiz2GaYs5mcmq5ut8Sep6xlmJq%2Fbr%2FOp2Sopqmteqyxy6WwZpmnlsZustGopGaopZe5qq%2BMnrCeq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
