I’m eager to get started and represent so many venue members across the US and Canada, many of whom I call friends, and to assist them as we drive more first-class content into their buildings”.</p><p>Armstrong’s career is rooted in Southern Californian venues, starting with her time at Costa Mesa’s Pacific Amphitheatre as Operations Manager.

During her tenure, the arena would see successful, sold-out events from artists such as <strong>Chris Rock</strong> and <strong>Dave Chapelle,</strong> <strong>Maroon 5</strong>, and <strong>Grupo Firme,</strong> in addition to a robust calendar of artists from diverse genres.</p><p>“We are thrilled to add JoAnn to our talented team,” says <strong>Andrew Prince, President of Venue Coalition.</strong> “She brings with her decades of extensive operational and programming experience at several high-profile venues, including a world-class NHL arena, and we welcome JoAnn’s expertise and continued passion for live entertainment. JoAnn is highly regarded amongst her peers, and her strong relationships and reputation within the industry will greatly benefit our organization as we continue to grow and expand on our mission to empower independent venues.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfJRoZ2xnppq7trGMnKaapJmptrC6jKeYpp2jYrewrc2nZJqqnajBs7vNoGSvqF2ks2680aieq5mdoravs44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
