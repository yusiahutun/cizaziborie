The&nbsp;search was the culmination of an eight-month-long surveillance of an illegal cigarette factory near Athens and a carefully laid dragnet involving more than 80 police personnel working practically around the clock.

Pensioners were asked to take a 740 million-euro hit last year to bolster the country’s social security system.</p>As Greece’s <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">new Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis</span></a>, seeks to make good on his campaign promise to ease the country’s tax burden, cracking down&nbsp;on such illicit activities is becoming critical.

Yet&nbsp;nearly a quarter of all cigarettes smoked in Greece&nbsp;last year were counterfeit,&nbsp;according to the KPMG report. Until 2015, the country was an import destination for fake-label cigarettes, with packs arriving by sea or road. A sharp increase in the duty on tobacco products during Greece’s crisis damped those inflows&nbsp;and brought the illicit production onshore.&nbsp;The number of legally sold cigarettes in Greece fell to 16.7 billion in 2018, almost half that in 2009, according to KPMG. Over the same period, the share of illegal&nbsp;cigarettes rose to 23.6 per cent of all smokes sold from 3 per cent. People operating these businesses have also been emboldened to export their fake cigarettes to countries such as Bulgaria, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Italy</span></a>, Romania, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Spain</span></a> and the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">UK</span></a>.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">New Athens mayor pledges major revamp of crisis-hit capital</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In recent years, nine factories have been identified in the Athens area for producing counterfeit cigarettes. Such&nbsp;operations are&nbsp;also rampant&nbsp;in other areas of Greece, including Thessaloniki. The illicit&nbsp;trade of tobacco and cigarettes has a huge social and economic cost, said&nbsp;Christos Harpantidis, chairman and CEO of Papastratos, the Greek unit of&nbsp;Philip Morris International Inc.“We all know that proceeds from illegal cigarettes are used to finance international crime rings, ” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the Athens area, much of the illicit production is concentrated in Aspropyrgos, an industrial suburb west of the capital that is full of factories –&nbsp;some of them abandoned –&nbsp;forming a maze of narrow streets and dead ends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/30/9a7772cc-cadf-11e9-b4e3-f796e392de6b_1320x770_125551.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Greek and Italian criminals involved in the 2017 haul had picked a location in Aspropyrgos because it is difficult for law enforcement agencies to enter the area without being noticed, said a&nbsp;police officer involved in the surveillance. To monitor the factory, the police transformed the terrace of a local hospital into an observation platform, even using drones. When they had finally gathered enough information, they organised the raids, halting the truck outside Thessaloniki while also breaking into the plant.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In this month’s raid, the organised crime unit of the Crete regional police said after&nbsp;many months of surveillance, it arrested four Greeks and a foreigner for the illegal production, distribution and export of contraband tobacco products. Producers of counterfeit cigarettes invest&nbsp;about 1 million euros to set up a plant, and recoup 10 times that amount&nbsp;within six months. With such huge returns on investment, the police have no doubt that more such operations&nbsp;will be mushrooming and they will constantly be playing whack-a-mole.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXymwdGop55nkafBqq%2FLnmZsaGJqfXOFjqGmsGWXp7Kmr8SsZK2noqeyr8CMn5iknV2Ytqit0Z6rrZ2jYrCwv9OipaBlk6TCr8DRsmSmoZyhtrC60g%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
