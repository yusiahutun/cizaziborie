Before deciding to start creating video tutorials, Wilkerson began her content development adventure via her blog.

Even though she exhibits outstanding carpentry abilities, April claims she isn’t an expert. She sees herself as a novice and a teacher wanting to impart her expertise to her students. Due to her escapades, April now co-hosts the reality series Assembly Required with Tim Allen and Richard Karn.</strong></p><h2><span id=Where_was_April_Wilkerson_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was April Wilkerson born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>The year <strong>1987</strong> saw the birth of April Wilkerson in Corpus Christi, Texas. She relocated to Fort Worth at the age of 19, where she remained for twelve years. April currently resides in Central Texas Hill County. She predicted that she would never leave Texas in the Call Me Mabie series. April declared, “I’ve always been in Texas and I always picture myself staying there forever.</p><p>When Wilkerson was younger, she was a skilled baton twirler before transitioning to tennis. According to her mother, April was a state, national, and world champion twirler. Wilkerson earned a degree in business management from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2012.</p><p>Before beginning her first woodworking project in January 2013, she had no prior experience. According to Wilkerson’s mother, April’s tenacity has contributed to her success to date:</p><p>She was a disaster from the beginning. independent and tough. You won’t divulge anything to her. She’s aware. Nevertheless, she exudes such sweetness and vivacity. She was wonderful.</p><p>Cody, Wilkerson’s engineer husband, doesn’t enjoy carpentry, so they don’t often collaborate on projects.</p><p>April’s enthusiasm for do-it-yourself projects grew after she and her husband Cody bought a home. April knew their kitchen needed a pantry, but she was appalled by the contractor’s $1,000 estimate. With time on her hands after graduating from college, April decided to build a pantry for her kitchen. After her accomplishment, April decided to use her blog to teach the rest of the world what she had discovered.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"To Know More: Emil Krafth, Javier Manquillo, Jacob Murphy, Miguel Almirón"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1061505,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"12":0,"15":"Arial","16":9,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":14,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":43}{"1":45,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":57}{"1":59,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":14,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/emil-krafth/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/javier-manquillo/"}{"1":43}{"1":45,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/jacob-murphy/"}{"1":57}{"1":59,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/miguel-almiron/"}{"1":73}'>To Know More: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Emil Krafth</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Javier Manquillo</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jacob Murphy</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Miguel Almirón</a></span></p><h2><span id=April_Wilkerson_decided_to_devote_her_full-time_to_content_development>April Wilkerson decided to devote her full-time to content development</span></h2><p>I approached the problem by saying, “Hey, I would really like a short duration to see what I can accomplish with this,” Wilkerson said. “At that moment in my life, I was married, and my spouse had just gotten his degree.” And after working for nine or ten hours a day, I’ll quit my job to pursue something that will merely make me happy. Can I do that? ’”</p><p>Cody gave his blessing, but oddly, he seldom ever showed up in April’s movies. Cody, a mechanical engineer by profession, has little interest in home renovation, metallurgy, or woodworking. Additionally, April explained that Cody’s quick thinking conflicts with her systematic, deliberate approach to producing things. In a May 2016 Q&A that she shared on her YouTube channel, Wilkerson said:</p><h2><span id=April_Wilkerson_realized_that_she_preferred_teaching_over_making_things>April Wilkerson realized that she preferred teaching over making things</span></h2><p>When April Wilkerson decided to construct a pantry in 2013, she was a total novice. She started by borrowing a drill and a circular saw because she didn’t have any tools. She acquired her tool collection from Craigslist and pawn shops. Additionally, she salvaged and reused materials that were unwanted by customers and restaurant chains.</p><p>Even before she had finished the project, Wilkerson had made up her mind to share her experience with creating a pantry. She wanted to fill the gap in online woodworking instruction because she had found it. April discovered that she liked teaching more than building as she put more effort into more projects and began creating video tutorials. She started to Woodworkers Journal that</p><p>“I had already decided to write up a guide for everything I did around the house when I finished the pantry. I felt a little bit hypocritical about learning how to build a pantry but keeping it to myself.</p><p>The success Wilkerson has today is a result of her passion to share her knowledge. April put time and effort into her hobby, and it paid off. She encourages individuals to pursue their passions even though she is aware doing so might be a risky endeavor. According to the DIY expert, Texas Monthly:</p><p>It’s very simple to let things like potential financial gain, a position of authority, or even the simplicity of one’s tasks influence one’s choice of the course one should take in life. While this may be sufficient for some people, my main piece of advice is to put some effort into discovering your passion. That’s when it all starts to make sense to me, I think. The way becomes clear when I have a passion to push me forward.</p><h2><span id=April_Wilkerson_wants_people_to_visit_her_home>April Wilkerson wants people to visit her home</span></h2><p>April wants to look around her home and realize that she constructed everything in it since her career began with a pantry. Despite having a lot of expertise in the field of woodworking, April occasionally runs into problems. She nevertheless continues to use the same trial-and-error approach that made her a sensation online. April gets motivated by mentally imagining the finished work. She explained to The Old House:</p><p>“I only build because I’m interested in the finished product. The only people I construct things for are my parents, but they don’t count. Yes, I consider what I want before starting to make it. Therefore, after looking around my home, I have a list of four and a half pages of improvements I want to make.</p><p>She told Woodworkers Journal, “If I haven’t constructed it, it has to go.” Although April acknowledges that building everything in her house will take years of work, she looks forward to the challenge. It’s unclear if her objectives have changed as a result of her foray into television. However, we are confident that her new endeavor will be a success based on her prior successes.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Is Michael Voltaggio Dating?
