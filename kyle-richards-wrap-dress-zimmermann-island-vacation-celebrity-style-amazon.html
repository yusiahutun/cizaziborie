Is it just Us or is vacation on your mind all of the time lately? We crave a vacation pretty much 24/7, 365 days of the year — but lately, our daydreams about relaxing on the beach have really been ramping up."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We crave a vacation pretty much 24/7, 365 days of the year — but lately, our daydreams about relaxing on the beach have really been ramping up. We need the sound of gentle ocean waves in our ears, the sights of a tropical sunset, the flavors of fresh-squeezed fruit juice — and obviously a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">super cute outfit </a>to go along with all of it!</p><p>Right now, we’re really looking to channel <strong>Kyle Richards</strong>, who just enjoyed an early start to summer in Turks and Caicos. Such a dream! We felt especially inspired when the Real Housewives star posted a mirror selfie on Instagram to capture the “island vibes” she had going on. Her wrap dress was everything! The price, however, was pushing it. That’s why we found <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">something to make our own</a> on Amazon!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kyle-richards-island-vibes-dress.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TEMOFON Summer Wrap Bohemian Floral Mini Dress</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$36</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, May 3, 2021, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>Richards wore a colorful Zimmermann wrap dress, a hot pink Chanel bag, heels, jewelry and sunglasses in her photo. We looked up the dress quickly, and not only did it cost $795, but it was almost totally sold out. It might even be gone by the time you read this. This situation definitely called for an Amazon moment, and that’s what we have here with this TEMOFON dress!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This dress</a> has a similar kind of look and feel, definitely radiating those “island vibes” and that carefree vacation mood. We love that it’s a wrap-style garment like Richards’ without actually being a full wrap dress. It’s sewn into place for you so you never have to deal with looping or tying anything yourself. You get the cute, flattering look and you don’t even have to think about the possibility of it coming undone!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TEMOFON Summer Wrap Bohemian Floral Mini Dress</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$36</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, May 3, 2021, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>This dress has a surplice V-neckline, short butterfly sleeves and a mini hem that’s pleated toward the bottom to create ruffles and add some swing to your step. We love how similar the neckline trim is to the one on Richards’ dress, and we’re obsessed with the mix of color-blocking and pattern-blocking. There are actually 12 different options for you to choose from, all with beautiful florals, so check them out!</p><p>Now, doesn’t imagining yourself wearing <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this dress</a>, walking barefoot on a white sandy beach during sunset just feel right? It feels more than right for Us. Just perfect.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TEMOFON Summer Wrap Bohemian Floral Mini Dress</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$36</a> at Amazon!
