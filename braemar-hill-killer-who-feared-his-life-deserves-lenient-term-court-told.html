Myers had at least 500 cuts to her body, while McBride had 100 cuts and had been strangled.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cheung, who is now 36 had pleaded not guilty, and Won Sam-lung who was also 16 at the time, were sentenced in 1987 to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure, an indefinite sentence known post-handover as at the Chief Executive's Discretion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Subsequent changes to the law required that the two be handed fixed-term sentences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Won, who had pleaded guilty and been a prosecution witness, received a sentence of 28 years and three months in August 2004. He was released a month later after having served two-thirds of the term. Three other men - ringleader Pang Shun-yee, 24, Tam Sze-foon, 20, and Chiu Wai-man, 25 - were convicted of murder in January 1987 and sentenced to death. Their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment in 1989.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">John Haynes, counsel for Cheung, argued before Mr Justice Frank Stock, Mr Justice Woo Kwok-hing and High Court Chief Judge Mr Justice Geoffrey Ma Tao-li that the sentence imposed on his client was too severe given the boy's belief that Pang would kill him if he refused to help out with the murder.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'While duress is not a defence, it is, and can be in the form of coercion, enormous mitigation ... particularly if it is combined with immaturity in the face of a mature, fearsome leader,' Mr Haynes said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Even crimes which [are] devoid of any element of human decency are susceptible to a degree of analysis as to what level of responsibility and liability each participant has.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He suggested that although duress was not allowed as a defence at the original trial, no one had challenged the assertions of either Won or Cheung that they took part in the murders only because the ringleader had threatened to kill them if they did not do so.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The two minors had been 'under the thumb of Pang and had been assaulted by him in the past ... and on top of that they had just seen him beat into a bloody pulp and rape a girl.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'The fact remains there is no evidence to contradict ... that they were in fear of their lives,' Mr Haynes said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The court reserved its decision until a later date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdlaIZ3fpJomauZlaKus3nHoqOlZZueua2x0Wauoaddm7KivsSdZKGho2K5qrLEZpueq5Wnw6a%2FjKWcp6GVo8FuwMSrpGabn6q%2FtXnTqKOd</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
