This little guy has already brought me so much happiness and a feeling of such a greater purpose. I cannot wait to meet you!!” Morgan wrote. “On a personal note, I have had the blessing of growing up in the public eye having started my acting career at age 6. While this has been incredible for me, I am very much looking forward to giving this little guy some room to grow up outside of the public eye, until he tells me otherwise .”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/madelaine-petsch.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/vanessa-morgan-2.jpg><p>She continued, “Lil one you were made with so much love & already exude a light so strong it warms my belly.

We know this is forever. Why would we wait?” he wrote at the time. “You literally stayed by my side when I felt I had lost my mind. You stayed by my side for these seemingly random changes of my life.…You’re undeniably the spark that reignited my fire. You’re deserving of much more than just this moment but this one just felt particularly magical.…I’ll never have enough words to tell you how much I love you, but I promise to always show you. But for now, I’ll finish this how I started: I love you. SO MUCH.”</p><p>Six months after their engagement, Kopech and Morgan married at the Historic Walton House in Homestead, Florida, in January 2020. In an interview with E! News at the time, Morgan opened up about how excited she was to spend her <a href=# rel=noopener>forever with Kopech</a>.</p><p>“We both knew the first day we met that ‘this is it’ and I’m so excited that today officially starts our forever,” she said at the time. “Today, I vowed to love my best friend for a lifetime and it was a day spent with those we love in a room filled with endless love. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with him.”</p><p>In an interview on the “White Sox Talk” podcast at the time, Kopech also opened up about how he knew Morgan was the one for him on their first date. “On our first date, it was just so easy and comfortable and relaxed.

Kopech filed for divorce on June 19 in Morris County in northeastern Texas, his hometown. News broke of their divorce on July 26.

I was about to move to Chicago for him.”</p><p>She continued, “I was literally with him for a week and then two days later, he was like, ‘Let’s just take a break.’ And I’m just like, ‘OK, dude.’ Like, ‘I’ll let you know when I’m ready for you.’”</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Michael Kopech’s&nbsp;Injury</span></h2><p>In September 2018, Kopech underwent ulna collateral ligament reconstruction surgery, better known as Tommy John surgery, to repair a significant tear near his UCL.
