In this case, an incredible woman, Dr. Pol’s wife, Diane Pol.</p><p id=par-3_23>Find out more about this extraordinary couple’s love story and how they met and came to build the little veterinary hospital that could.</p><h2>Dr. Pol’s journey to becoming a veterinarian</h2><p id=par-4_22>Born in the Netherlands, Dr. Pol attended Utrecht University Veterinary College in the 1970s and studied hard to become an animal practitioner.</p><p id=par-5_45>“I was the youngest of six children on a dairy farm in the Netherlands during World War II. When I was 12 years old, the local veterinarian had me come along to my brother’s farm to help with some small sows that were farrowing.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_20>“That was the beginning of my interest in veterinary practice and I subsequently worked toward pursuing a veterinary medicine degree.”</p><p id=par-7_71>“In 1954, my youngest sister moved to Ontario, Canada, and I became an exchange student in Michigan during 1961 to 1962, which allowed my parents to visit my sister in Canada. When I began studies . . . , we were told that it would be impossible to practice in that country. As it turned out, of a dozen classmates, I am one of two that actually went into veterinary practice.”</p><h2>The Incredible Diane Pol</h2><p id=par-8_33>Diane is a 100% partner at the animal clinic and although she does not help to treat the animals, it is her administrative know-how and organization that keeps the busy clinic moving smoothly.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_59>“My first experience after graduating was working for a veterinarian in Harbor Beach, Michigan,” Dr. Pol told <a href=#>Today’s Veterinary Practice in 2012</a>. “However, my wife, Diane, and I were eager to start our own practice here in Weidman, Michigan. When the practice opened in 1981, 80% of our practice was dairy, with the remaining 20% equine and small animals.”</p><p id=par-10_48>“We worked out of a room built in the corner of the garage until the practice outgrew that small space. Diane and I managed to buy more property next door and build a clinic—a double-wide trailer, which was all we could afford with interest rates close to 20%.”</p><h2>How the Pols met</h2><p id=par-11_27>Before marrying his wife Diane, Dr. Pol <a href=#>considered moving to New Zealand </a>to open up a veterinary practice. But his plans changed after meeting his life partner.</p><p id=par-12_62><a href=#>Diane and Jan Pol met</a> when he was a foreign exchange student at Mayville<br>High School in 1961 during her senior year. They kept up a correspondence after he returned to the Netherlands. After a while, Dr. Pol asked Diane to come and meet his parents. At that point, they knew their relationship was beyond pen pals and that they wanted to marry.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-13_22>Eventually, the couple married in 1967, continued living in the Netherlands for a few years more, and finally moved back to Michigan.</p><p id=par-14_31>Diane earned a Special Reading master’s degree wand was a reading teacher until 1981 when she left teaching to help Dr. Pol run his business and care for their children.</p><p id=par-15_6>She really is an incredible partner!</p><p id=par-16_12>Read more: ‘<a href=#><strong>The Incredible Dr. Pol’: The Real Reason Dr. Emily Left</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMoqWcqpWZtqO4xGabq2WgpLluwMeeZKunnZa7tbXCZq6asV2ptaZ51Z6rZpmemXqptdJmrqKelWK6psCMmqWdZZaaua15yKdkpaemmnupwMylZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
