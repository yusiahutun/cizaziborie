With the release of the “Love Yourself: Answer” album on Friday, K-pop giants BTS have closed a momentous chapter in their record-breaking career that has seen them become the biggest Korean act internationally.
The final release of the two-and-a-half-year-long “Love Yourself” album series, only seven of its 25 tracks are new, with the rest drawn from previous albums in the series. Despite being a largely repackaged album, it will satisfy diehard fans and pique the interest of those who are new to the group."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

His line, “Even when I’m in the practice room/I’m happy because I’m with you” could be a nod to the huge number of fans worldwide watching BTS’ every move.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/24/2061b7e2-a75c-11e8-851a-8c4276191601_1320x770_200008.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Trivia: Love showcases Rap Monster’s talents as vocalist as he skilfully pulls off an R&B love song. He employs some clever puns in Korean in his lyrics, although overseas fans will have to work these out for themselves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Suga, who has often proven his skill at writing melancholy lyrics, does it again in Trivia: Seesaw, a fizzy, synthesiser-driven number which charts the end of a relationship. The vocalist laments he is now “alone on the see-saw” as the track draws to a close.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Epiphany, one of the album’s stand-out tracks, is a thought-provoking ballad. Sounding deceptively like a love song, it is actually about the importance of loving oneself – a message that hopefully will resonate in South Korea, a country where the number one cause of death among teenagers is suicide.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The new single Idol, on which band members are joined by US rapper/singer Nicki&nbsp;Minaj, is an intriguing mix of tribal dance beats and traditional Korean rhythms. BTS members grunt out centuries-old Korean “response words” (usually heard at traditional folk music performances to express the audience’s approval) in between singing about the woes of being international stars.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Jin from BTS: the life and thoughts of the best looking guy in the band</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the accompanying video, BTS don traditional Korean garb, and the track itself features ancient Korean percussion instruments such as the ggwenggari, jing and janggu. Although this is not the first track to combine traditional Korean music with modern grooves – artist Seo Taeji did it in the early 1990s – BTS have taken it to the next level by bringing in Minaj and exposing Korean traditions to a huge global audience.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although padded with plenty of previously released material, such as the earlier hits Fake Love and The Truth Untold (featuring US DJ Steve Aoki), the new album should ensure BTS’ reign as the kings of K-pop will continue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLa4066pnmedqsCqr46aqa2hk6GycH6Qb2hrbmhkr7W%2FjJqjm62dYrmwwsRmsKitoqiyrbKMmqWsr5WnerOx1aKcsGWjqrSieclmn6iolWKur7CMq5ipZZ2ku7TAxKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
