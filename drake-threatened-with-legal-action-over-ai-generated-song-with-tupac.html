The artists have clubbed together and sign the document encouraging the US government to do more when it comes to protecting fans from resale concert tickets at sky-high prices, and from scams from ticket touters. The artists wrote that as members of the music community, they rely on touring for their livelihood and that they value their fans above all else. They added that the current system is broken due to the predatory resellers. If the bill is passed, it will prohibit fake tickets and deceptive marketing tactics that trick genuine ticket buyers. Other stars who have been involved include Diplo, Fall Out Boy and Becky G.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ad2a705d68f0-billie-eilish-oscars-2024.jpg><p id=e1tqIJ1A7O7 data-wc=113>Drake has been threatened with legal action from the estate of the late rapper Tupac Shakur. The Canadian artist was issued with a cease and desist letter from an attorney who represents the estate, requesting that Drake remove a song he shared on his online platforms that featured AI-generated vocals for the later rap icon. A statement from the estate branded the move from Drake a flagrant violation of Tupac's publicity and blatant abuse of the legacy of one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time. The estate also took issue with the subject of the track, which was seemingly a diss track in the ongoing feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1bafe392f86a-drake.png><p id=eHsKZQBhrQK data-wc=119>Lily Allen has said that she could venture into the country music space in the future. The singer, who hasn't released music since 2018's No Shame, was chatting on the Dish Podcast with Nick Grimshaw and Angela Hartnett when she said that she isn't working towards a particular deadline, adding she's left to her own devices when it comes to making her own music. But the Not Fair singer added that she loves country and western music and could be tempted to veer into the genre in the future. There's no word on when Lily will release new stuff but she said she's currently working on material to see what works. Let's hope she doesn’t keep us waiting long.</p><p id=eKizRuxTZ3B data-wc=87>Eminem has officially confirmed he'll be releasing his first album in four years this year.
