Food inflation has historically been a key issue for voters in India.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">India’s exports of non-basmati varieties are also being affected by the limited quantities available to private traders, as well as the long shipping times and more expensive freight costs to parts of Africa and other places, said Prem Garg, national president of the Indian Rice Exporters Federation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">High freight costs have also resulted in disputes as exporters push to negotiate their contracts with buyers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Old contracts with buyers are being disputed. Many people want to cancel their orders,” Garg said, adding that the cost of booking a single container on ships to Africa had tripled to US$4,000.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Red Sea risks could push oil prices up as Asia feels pinch of cargo delays</span></p></a></h3>The logistics nightmare has had less of an impact on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Thailand</span></a> and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Vietnam</span></a>, the world’s second- and third-ranked rice exporters, because they send fewer shipments via the Middle Eastern hotspot, traders say.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“India and Pakistan’s exports are more affected. Thailand and Vietnam exports are in a lull period and will pick up after Ramadan [expected to end on April 9],” said a Thailand-based rice trader who asked not to be identified.</p>Indian rice is usually cheaper than comparable Thai and Vietnamese varieties and is preferred in parts of Africa, the trader said.

Benchmark Brent crude futures nudged above US$80 per barrel last week following an escalation of hostilities by Houthi rebels, including an attack on a fuel tanker on Friday.

Imports, however, will not likely be used to make up the shortfall, and China will instead see reduced consumption and a drawdown of stocks.
