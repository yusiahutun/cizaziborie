He and his costars quickly became worldwide phenomenons, but little did we know, we were pronouncing his name wrong this entire time.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/07/GettyImages-1390930927-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-lautner-reveals-how-to-actually-say-his-last-name>Taylor Lautner reveals how to actually say his last name</h2><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> actor joined The Unplanned Podcast With Matt & Abby recently, and made a revelation no one was expecting, so how do you actually say his name?</p><p>“It is technically ‘Lowt-ner.’ But I just never, in interviews or anything, stopped someone and said, ‘It’s not ‘Lawt-ner,’ it’s ‘Lowt-ner,'” the star told listeners.</p><p>Although, no need to fret if you’ve been pronouncing his name wrong all these years, as the star’s not fussed. “I just go with whatever. I don’t care,” he revealed.</p><p>“It is my fault that nobody knows how it’s actually pronounced because I never corrected anybody for decades,” he continued.</p><p>But why has he let us say it wrong this whole time? Well, it’s actually because he was too nervous to correct anyone during his younger days.</p><p>“I think when I was 11, like after Sharkboy and Lavagirl, I wasn’t gonna tell people they were pronouncing my name wrong,” the star explained.</p><p>So to conclude, it’s Lowt-ner, not Lawt-ner.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-can-t-believe-they-ve-been-saying-his-name-wrong>Fans can’t believe they’ve been saying his name wrong</h2><p>Of course, this huge revelation caused a stir on social media.</p><p>“OMG been mispronouncing Taylor Lautner’s last name this entire time…” said one <a href=#>Twitter</a> fan.</p><p>“Taylor Lautner going on to a podcast and being like “…I’ve never corrected anyone on how to say my name properly” is SO ‘born on February 11’ coded,” joked one.</p><p>“Btw I found out Taylor Lautner’s last name is pronounced LAWTNER instead of LOTNER wtf I will not be pronouncing it that way ever I’m sorry I can’t bring myself to do it I tried I really did its just too much for me rn,” wrote another.</p><p>“When I tell u I gasped so f****** loud when Taylor Lautner said his last name is pronounced ‘lowt-ner’ and not ‘lot-ner’. I HAVE BEEN PRONOUNCING HIS LAST NAME WRONG FOR LIKE THE PAST 7 YEARS??? LIKE WHAT???”</p><p>However, it seems like not everyone has been saying it wrong as one fan tweeted: “I’ve been saying it correctly since new moon I care about you king.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-twilight-actor-joins-his-ex-on-stage>The Twilight actor joins his ex on stage</h2><p>Another blast from the past, Taylor Lautner recently came on stage at his ex, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>‘s concert.</p><p>After having her ex cameo in her latest <a href=#>music</a> video, Swift invited her ex Lautner on stage at her Kansas City show of her Eras Tour to debut the vid.</p><p>The Twilight actor made a grand entrance by doing backflips on stage before greeting his ex with a hug.</p><p>Lautner and Swift broke up at the end of 2009 after several months of dating, however, as we can see here, the two are still on great terms.</p><p>We wonder if she was saying his name right.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlvX2aAcMDAsqOoql2hrrbAzZ6pZqCRqHqjscSnZKWdpKm2r7OMqZyoqJyaerSt2Gafoqtdo66usYywqaiml2LBqbXSZpynrJmnsm7AyKacaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
