"The crazy part is, we were home at the time. We were at the office. And all of a sudden, police cars, helicopters, everything," he said, per <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p>He tried to figure out why this neighbor, who he described as living "almost right across the street" from him, was even targeted. "There are a lot of beautiful houses in the neighborhood," he noted. "But that house is kind of modest." He did acknowledge, though, that "they do have five expensive cars."</p><p>The reality star did note that the woman didn't suffer any broken bones or serious injuries. She's "just bruised, banged up a little," he explained, sharing that it appears she's going to be just fine.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:39376a7f-3f3d-47d6-aa97-ce8785a419e5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8b7ed340-21f6-4fe1-9565-4e61a3faa4d9 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/63/5by4/2022/08/18/6366c88ef2de46eca39a0d0632e2fefb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Dean Purcell/New Zealand Herald via AP</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Woman Believed to Be Mother of 2 Children Found in New Zealand Suitcases Is in South Korea: Seoul Police</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Lewis detailed the police response to the brazen daylight attack, including that they came to his house asking to see any security footage he might have. He said that due to obstructions, his cameras didn't capture anything useful.</p><p>Hilariously, he said he did draw the line at fully allowing them access to all of his security footage for a very personal reason.</p><p>"I said, 'Look guys, my AV cabinet is downstairs and I kind of don't want you going through it. Because, to be honest with you, one of these cameras faces the backyard and I don't always wear clothes back there,'" he told his listeners.</p><p>He said that sometimes when his daughter's not home, "we might go in the pool and sex it up," even adding that he doesn't always even know what happens back there because he gets "so drunk."</p><p>"So I did not surrender the DVR," he concluded. "I did not cooperate."</p><a id=gallery-link-0a7d2242-0345-4627-a9ef-caaf2b957f42 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:0a7d2242-0345-4627-a9ef-caaf2b957f42 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:8b7ed340-21f6-4fe1-9565-4e61a3faa4d9 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d9/4by3/2022/08/15/d914e007fce842c8a534a4a608bb4a82_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3FmanFfn7KnsoylnLCho2K1sLnEZm5qZamarrN5zqWbZqaVnrSprs6rZJqknJq0prDLsmSarKSWsKyxw2apqJqSmrFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
