The Buffy alum, 42, took to Instagram on Tuesday, September 24, to share two photos taken in the same city almost two decades apart. “So (gulp) 19 years ago, @realfreddieprinze and I took our first trip as a new couple, to #lasvegas (and it was my first time in Vegas) One of the things we did, was ride the gondolas at the @venetianvegas,” the actress wrote alongside the snaps."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The happy couple tied the knot in 2002. They share two kids — daughter Charlotte, 10, and son Rocky. The pair once revealed what the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">secret behind their incredible marriage</a> is.</p><p>“Communicate. That’s the key. It’s about being present,” the Cruel Intentions&nbsp;star told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>. “Listening is the most important thing.” The&nbsp;Summer Catch actor, 43, added, “We still make each other laugh. And we treat each other with respect.”</p><p>The famous pair have also spoken about how important it is for them to create <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">happy memories with their little ones</a> as the years go by. “It’s about making the most of the moments that you have. We’re all time-impoverished, we’re all busy. But I make sure, when I’m there, that I’m present. I’m not checking my phone. I’m not doing a million things,” Sarah explained.</p><p>“I think conversation is really important. I can’t tell you how many times I go to a restaurant and I see families, the second they sit down they just hand out iPads and phones to the kids, and I’m thinking to myself, ‘This should be a special time.’ Like, I remember when I was younger and I got to go out to eat, that was such a special occasion; that’s what grown-ups did. I want to maintain that for my family,” the Hollywood star continued.</p><p>It is so great seeing how much love these two have for each other!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46smKuZmGK6qq%2FHnqOlnV2csq24wKtkq52Tp7KiwMSsZK%2BZk5bBqrvNZq6irJhis7Oxw52gnmWgp7avxsRmoatn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
