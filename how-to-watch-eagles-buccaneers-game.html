In one of the coldest games in <a href=# id=auto-tag_nfl data-tag=nfl>NFL</a> history, the Kansas City Chiefs secured a 26-7 blowout win against the Miami Dolphins, just hours after rookie quarterback CJ Stroud led the Houston Texans to a 45-14 victory against the Cleveland Browns.&nbsp;</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anua-cleansing-oil-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><p>On Sunday, the action continued with the Green Bay Packers dominating the Dallas Cowboys 48-32 at their home field, while over in Detroit, the Lions clinched their first playoff victory in 32 years against the Los Angeles Rams. Now, tonight’s primetime game will see the Eagles take on the Buccaneers in this postseason matchup, with the winner slated to face the Lions back in Detroit next weekend.</p><p>Tonight’s showdown has an extra layer of uncertainty, as both of the team’s quarterbacks are still battling injuries. Despite being listed as questionable due to rib and ankle injuries, Buccaneers’ quarterback Baker Mayfield is expected to take the field. Mayfield expressed gratitude for the support he’s received since signing his one-year contract with the Bucs in March, <a href=# rel=nofollow>saying</a>, “It’s meant the world to me just to be able to be in a stable place, to be the best version of myself.” He added, “It’s been great for me, but (we’re) not done yet.”</p><p>On the other hand, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is also gearing up to play after dislocating his finger in Week 18 of the regular season. Coach Nick Sirianni acknowledged his resilience, <a href=# rel=nofollow>telling</a> reporters, “He’s tough, and he’ll do everything that he can do to play through it.” As both signal-callers navigate their respective injuries, the air is thick with anticipation to find out who will win this Wild Card matchup at Raymond James Stadium.</p><p>For everything you need to know about how to watch the Eagles vs Buccaneers game live for free, keep on reading below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/buccaneers-eagles.jpeg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=when-does-the-eagles-vs-buccaneers-game-air><strong>When does the Eagles vs Buccaneers game air?</strong></h2><p>The Eagles vs Buccaneers game airs on Monday, January 15, 2024, at 8:15 p.m. ET / 5:15 p.m. PT on ABC and ESPN.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-to-watch-the-eagles-vs-buccaneers-game-live-for-free><strong>How to watch the Eagles vs Buccaneers game live for free</strong></h2><p>The Eagles vs Buccaneers game will air on ABC and ESPN, which are available to stream on services like<a href=# rel=nofollow> DirecTV Stream</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Fubo</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Sling Orange</a>, and<a href=# rel=nofollow> Hulu+ With Live TV</a>.
