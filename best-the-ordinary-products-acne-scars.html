The Ordinary‘s affordable line of clinical-forward skincare products has amassed quite the cult following since it launched a few years back, and thanks to platforms like TikTok and Reddit, its popularity continues to grow. While TO’s expansive range of skincare and beauty (they do offer a few cosmetics now) was founded with the intention to “to celebrate integrity in its most humble and true form,” if you’re not an expert in decoding fancy skincare jargon, it can tricky to figure out what exactly you need based on your specific skin concern(s)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While TO’s expansive range of skincare and beauty (they do offer a few cosmetics now) was founded with the intention to “to celebrate integrity in its most humble and true form,” if you’re not an expert in decoding fancy skincare jargon, it can tricky to figure out what exactly you need based on your specific skin concern(s). With the help of Reddit and some brand research, however, we’ve rounded up a few of the best <a href=# rel=noopener>The Ordinary products for fading acne scars</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_dark-spots data-tag=dark-spots>dark spots</a> left over from previous breakouts and sun damage.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>While scouring through customer reviews and best-sellers on any e-retailer is always a good way to figure out which beauty products you should spend your hard-earned cash on, we know you don’t have time to scroll through endless threads and message boards. Lucky for you, we’ve gone ahead and done the work for you (you’re welcome!). And TBH, for me this very activity is actually fun (and a part of my job, of course). Besides, I’ve been using <a href=# rel=noopener>The Ordinary products</a> since the brand first debuted, and I most certainly have lots of holy grail products I’ve repurchased multiple times—especially when it comes to erasing hyperpigmentation and pesky spots.</p><p>With that being said, I wasn’t all that surprised that many fellow Redditors and TO fans also named a few of my favorite products from line, including the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%</a> serum and the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution</a> (an excellent dupe for the cult-favorite <a href=# rel=noopener>Triple Berry Smoothing peel</a> by Renee Rouleau) as their hero products, too. Oh, and while it’s always important to apply SPF on the daily, make sure to be extra diligent about applying your sunscreen when using the following products.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-ordinary-azelaic-acid.jpg><h2>Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%</h2><p>This lightweight cream-gel hybrid feels nourishing like your favorite moisturizer, but according to Redditors, it does much more than just hydrate. “<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TO’s Azelaic Acid 10%</a> is doing wonders for my skin, pretty much overnight! It’s a skin brightener that targets <a href=# id=auto-tag_acne data-tag=acne>acne</a> and acne scarring well,” says one fan of the gel-cream treatment.</p><h2 class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-title-lg data-transform data-truncate>Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%</h2><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$7.90</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-ordinary-glycolic-toning-solution-amazon.jpg><h2>Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution</h2><p>This popular exfoliating toner kept popping up during my research process, and I totally understand why it’s such a go-to for nixing <a href=# id=auto-tag_acne-scars data-tag=acne-scars>acne scars</a> given the Glycolic Acid content. ” I use [the] <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Glycolic 7% toner</a> daily, and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">alpha arbutin</a> a couple times a week. The aha is pretty strong for me, so I use it maybe 2x a month. It’s a process but worth it,” says one Reddit user.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-ordinary-peeling-solution-ulta.jpg><h2>AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution</h2><p>This is probably my absolute <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">favorite product from the brand</a>—and it appears that I’m not alone. One Redditor gushed “Really noticeable improvements after one use! It’s also less than $8 you’re not going to find anything for such a good price!” I totally agree, and good point about the jaw-dropping cheap price.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-ordinary-niacinamide-serum-skinstore.jpg><h2>Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%</h2><p>As one of my favorite <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">brightening serums</a> of all time (regardless of the budget-friendly price point), I wasn’t surprised by this product’s popularity. One loyal fan commented that “The niacinamide [serum] has faded my scars significantly! By far my favorite TO product so far.” I also find that it is a great brightening solution for sensitive skin types who don’t tolerate vitamin C skincare.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-ordinary-alpha-arbutin.jpg><h2>Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA</h2><p>Arbutin works to reduce the look of dark spots and acne scarring because it helps to limit the <span>production of excess melanin without causing further damage (and scarring, ironically enough) as popular anti-scarring ingredient, hydroquinone.</span><span>&nbsp;“</span>I have PIH around my mouth from cystic acne and using the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">niacinamide</a> with the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">alpha arbutin</a> has given me great results,” raves one acne-scar-sufferer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/the-ordinary-vitamin-c-suspension-ha-spheres-skinstore.png><h2><span>Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres</span></h2><p><span>Vitamin C multitasks to help improve so many skin concerns at once, including fading unwanted dark spots.
