"These lyrics, they tell so much," Brown&nbsp;continues. "The song just stands on its own."</p><p>Fellow Home Free vocalist (and another fan of Mayer's) Tim Foust was also drawn to the song, calling it "brilliant."</p><p>"The first time I heard it I was like 'this is a country song, and a really good country song at that,'" he says.</p><p>As a whole, the group agrees that "In the Blood," "Castle on the Hill" and "Can't Outrun You" are three covers that help move them in a new direction, embodying a sense of depth they're hoping to achieve.</p><p>"That was a huge push that we had for this album was to try and get more emotional depth out of our music, try to get a little deeper, little more adult," says the group's Adam Rupp.</p><p>"I think one of the important things about both of those songs too is that going into the album, we didn't want it to be a static album, we didn't want it to be just kind of the same," adds the group's Adam&nbsp;Chance. "We wanted to have push and pulls, and ups and downs, and some emotion here, some high-power stuff here, so I think those two songs kind of made it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoaedmnqnvsSeZKOnmKN6rq3Ynqlmm5%2BrsrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
