He grew up as the fourth son of the Cocaine Godmother—a Colombian drug lord who was prominent in Miami, US, during the 1970s through the early 2000s. With his mother as the subject of a biographical Netflix series, the question of where Michael Corleone Blanco is now is left in many viewers’ minds considering they will have watched the demise of his family."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She wanted to be as powerful as she could, and she was ruthless about it. She wanted power in order to care for her family, to do everything she could for her children,” she said in a press statement.</p><p>“That’s something all women, especially mothers, can understand, whether we can understand the way she went about it or not. In the world she came from, she did what she knew how to do. But the truth is, only the real Griselda could tell you why she did all that she did.” So <a href=#>where is Michael Corleone Blanco now</a> and how does he feel about Griselda?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-is-michael-corleone-blanco-now>Where is Michael Corleone Blanco now?</h2><p><a href=#>Where is Michael Corleone Blanco now?</a> Michael Corleone Blanco is Griselda’s fourth son and only child with Darío Sepúlveda. He’s the only son of the Black Widow left alive. At the time of his 2020 interview with The Mirror, Michael lived in&nbsp;Miami with his three children. And yes, if his name sounds familiar, that’s because he gets it from the central character in&nbsp;The Godfather&nbsp;series.</p><p>He is the founder of<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;Pure Blanco</a>, which the website describes as “a billionaire cartel lifestyle brand” that focuses on fashion, movies, music, and cannabis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/michael-corleone-blanco-1.png><p>In 2012, he was arrested for cocaine trafficking, according to the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Miami New Times</a>. He was charged with trying to buy five kilos from an undercover detective using $10,000 in cash, a motorcycle, and a diamond necklace and pendant inscribed with the phrase&nbsp;Kill All Rats.</p><p>He was subsequently released from house arrest and starred in VH1’s&nbsp;Cartel Crews. He has also talked extensively about his mom in various media and has set to have a book, My Mother, The Godmother, and The True Story. “My mum had been balling since the 60s,” he told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Independent</a>. “Pioneer s***. Never again, that s*** was crazy.”</p><p>He recalled the day he found out his mother died, “It was a call I had been dreading for years,” he said. “I’d spoken to her at two that morning. They said to me, ‘Michael, I’m standing over your mother’s dead body.’</p><p>“Even right now it brings tears to my eyes because I was with my boys when I got that phone call. I was teaching my youngest one how to swim. I said, ‘I’m not going to let these kids live the life that I lived.’</p><p>“But to get out of that life you have to let certain individuals know there won’t be any retributions. It was taken care of in the old country, Colombia.”</p><p>Days before the premiere of the Netflix show, Michael Corleone, identified as Michael Sepulvedablanco in the lawsuit documents, and his wife, Marie, are seeking damages “in excess of $50,000,” as well as an emergency temporary injunction to block the January 25 release of&nbsp;Griselda.</p><p>In a statement to DailyMail, he explained his&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>reasoning for legal action</a>, “I feel that it’s my duty to do it. And if I didn’t, I wouldn’t be keeping my word to my OG, to my mother. I’m just holding it down for the family – and I’m doing it legally.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/griselda-blanco-.jpg><p>He continued, ‘I am a history buff so I believe that history should be told not only by the victors but by the losers. You can call me what you want but I’m in both worlds. Some people will say, ‘You’re glorifying the lifestyle’. I glorify my mother but when you read my book and you’ll see my public apology to the masses, and to the victims of the 1970s and 1980s cocaine and crack wars. I’m apologetic because I myself am a victim… I buried 22 members of my family. I survived countless assassination attempts. Look at the way I lost my mother.”</p><p>He also slammed the show’s use of prosthetics when transforming Vergara into Griselda. “My mother was a beautiful woman&nbsp;and it’s crazy that a lot of people say ‘No, you’ve got to look more like a drug addict’ …&nbsp;The fact that they call her ‘ugly’; that really offends me,” he said. “People see the mug shots and just go from that. But when you read my book, you’ll see that&nbsp;my mother was called the porcelain doll in her youth. Mayors, governors and politicians in different countries would try to court my mother… even here in the United States. She was the crème de la crème.”</p><p>Michael accused the show’s creators of using his unreleased “artistic literary work” and his likeness “to depict the life story of himself and his mother, Griselda Blanco De Trujillo” without permission or credit, according to the lawsuit obtained by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Tonight.</a></p><p>The family told the site: “It is beyond dispute that Griselda Blanco made the ultimate decision for Michael Blanco, her son, to carry out and benefit from her life as it relates to artistic and literary productions based on her story. Although Michael Blanco is a public figure himself with his own rights to publicity, Mr. Blanco continues to honor his mother’s executed intent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_16ad4f.png><p>A profile of bloodthirsty Colombian drug dealer Griselda Blanco, known as the “Black Widow” due to her penchant for killing off her lovers, recounts <a data-pmc-sp-product=ac48495d7ea88daa3005e7dce76204d6 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Blanco’s vicious crime spree","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"The Godmother: The True Story of the Hunt for the Most Bloodthirsty Female Criminal in Our Time","id":"0671701932","category":"True Crime"},"id":1712438,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Blanco’s vicious crime spree</a> and the ten-year struggle to bring her to justice. Court records and interviews with Drug Enforcement Administration agents, federal attorneys, Miami police and Blanco’s acquaintances flesh out a portrait of a ruthless cocaine wholesaler whose “mules” (couriers) transported drugs in women’s undergarments and shoe heels. Her propensity for violence was legendary: she bragged of murdering her husband and claimed responsibility for Miami’s “Dadeland Massacre,” a shootout in a mall parking lot that disposed of one of Blanco’s creditors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmK6sMLInqpoaWdmf3V%2Fl2ikopuYlrKtecKoqaWdn6Oybq7LmqWcp12jvLh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
