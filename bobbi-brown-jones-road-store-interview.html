Why are you doing this now? Just wait until next year,’” Brown recounts over Zoom. She’s hunkered down at her home in Montclair, New Jersey (approximately 20 miles outside of New York City), wearing a cozy black sweatshirt with the brand’s name emblazoned across the chest in its trademark block-white lettering. “And I just said, ‘We don’t even know what next year is gonna bring. It could be worse. And you know what, my noncompete’s up.’”</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Jones Road The Bobbi Kit Her Favorites</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$82 at jonesroadbeauty.com for The Bobbi Kit Her Favorites" data-href="https://jonesroadbeauty.com/products/the-bobbi-kit?variant=40933476008086" data-product-url="https://jonesroadbeauty.com/products/the-bobbi-kit?variant=40933476008086" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjonesroadbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-bobbi-kit%3Fvariant%3D40933476008086" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$82 at jonesroadbeauty.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jonesroadbeauty.com/products/the-bobbi-kit?variant=40933476008086" data-vars-ga-product-brand="Jones Road" data-vars-ga-product-id=8c382b2c-4811-47d1-9c01-ffbcab0fa1ce data-vars-ga-product-price=$82.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=ef78aa7f-47a8-4e08-b569-5b663ccfccbf data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=40933476008086 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="The Bobbi Kit Her Favorites" title="The Bobbi Kit Her Favorites" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1636401328-JonesRoad_BobbiKit_01_1bb52113-bdd7-434a-a8e0-e1b8cc13b280_1024x1024.jpg width=787 height=1024 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Jones Road The Bobbi Kit Her Favorites</h2></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Let it be noted: Brown doesn’t wait for opportunity. She creates it. Despite the skepticism of others, the makeup legend launched Jones Road with a streamlined collection of versatile—and, most notably, clean—makeup and beauty products, including a wildly successful, award-winning <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jonesroadbeauty.com/products/miracle-balm?variant=40809269723286" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Miracle Balm" data-vars-ga-product-id=391a125e-476d-479c-892c-3471357147e9 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://jonesroadbeauty.com/products/miracle-balm?variant=40809269723286" data-product-url="https://jonesroadbeauty.com/products/miracle-balm?variant=40809269723286" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjonesroadbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fmiracle-balm%3Fvariant%3D40809269723286" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=jonesroadbeauty.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=ed0dd9f9-effa-49b5-8e71-0c157f97b596 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=jonesroadbeauty.com class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Miracle Balm</a>, which today remains the brand’s “hero” item for its multipurpose, glow-boosting qualities. (Indeed, its wait list between restock shipments has counted up 10,000 names.) To celebrate the past year’s success, Brown is opening a flagship Jones Road store in Montclair.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The date of our interview holds an especially symbolic meaning for Brown, who launched Jones Road almost exactly 25 years after her noncompete agreement with beauty giant Estée Lauder (which acquired her original namesake brand in 1995) completed its term. “My 25-year noncompete ended on October 24th, which was a weekend, so we launched on a Monday—the 26th,” she explains.</p><img alt="jones road bobbi brown" title="jones road bobbi brown" width=944 height=1432 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2021-11-08-at-5-47-10-pm-1636411650.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Amy Lombard</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Brown didn’t intend to build another beauty brand after leaving her company in 2016, but the almost involuntary itch to create never abated. “I just didn’t feel done. Not only do I love being a makeup artist, I love being a teacher. I love the creative process of marketing and product development, and I missed it,” she says. What’s more, she felt the current beauty landscape wasn’t adequately fulfilling the needs of today’s consumers: a growing number of savvier, better-informed beauty shoppers seeking connection and transparency, who care about the sourcing and effects of ingredients on the body, both inside and out.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I just didn’t feel done. Not only do I love being a makeup artist, I love being a teacher. <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I knew there was a different way to do it. I didn’t set out to create a ‘clean’ brand,” she goes on. “I just created the brand I wanted with the best, most efficacious formulas—and didn’t have any ingredients that I wasn’t comfortable putting on my face.” The fact that Jones Road ultimately became a clean beauty brand somewhat organically speaks to the increasing popularity and normalization of the category. Just as Brown, a self-professed “health-fanatic” maintains a healthy lifestyle involving a wholesome diet and regular exercise, today’s consumers are also making a greater number of lifestyle choices dictated by wellness and well-being (including that of the planet), rather than cost or prestige. “Beauty, like health, is an evolution,” Brown notes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Buyer beware: There’s no official governing body or widely known organization to designate what qualifies as a “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a28352553/clean-beauty/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=clean class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">clean</a>” brand—no seals of approval, nor certifications—which puts the onus squarely on the consumer. That’s created plenty of gray area for greenwashing and pseudo-virtuous products out there to cash in on the demand. Despite launching Jones Road as a direct-to-consumer brand, Brown looked to the reputable clean beauty retailer Credo and its standard-setting <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://credobeauty.com/pages/packaging data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dirty List" data-vars-ga-product-id=a14faec7-209d-450a-bc49-afb8189db08d data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://credobeauty.com/pages/packaging data-product-url=https://credobeauty.com/pages/packaging data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcredobeauty.com%2Fpages%2Fpackaging" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=d71ad327-1f1c-4c51-b191-73114fa05d38 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Dirty List</a> (an index of more than 2,700 banned ingredients from any third-party products it sells) when formulating her own products.</p><img alt="jones road store montclair, new jersey bobbi brown" title="jones road store montclair, new jersey bobbi brown" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jrstoreinterior-1636411499.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jones Road</span></p><img alt="jones road store montclair, new jersey bobbi brown" title="jones road store montclair, new jersey bobbi brown" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jrstorefront-1636411530.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jones Road</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Launching a digital-native makeup company requires a fair amount of faith, not to mention an actual up-front investment, on the part of its first-time consumers. But with Brown’s bona fides and a trim lineup of multipurpose products that work across an array of skin tones, all showcased on a simple, modern website conveying a refreshing sense of confidence, Jones Road exceeded first-day sales projections by 150 percent. After all this time, Brown still has her finger on the pulse of hit-making makeup.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">The 101 Set Your New Favorites</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$97 at jonesroadbeauty.com for The 101 Set Your New Favorites" data-href="https://jonesroadbeauty.com/products/the-101-set?variant=40854385557654" data-product-url="https://jonesroadbeauty.com/products/the-101-set?variant=40854385557654" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjonesroadbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-101-set%3Fvariant%3D40854385557654" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$97 at jonesroadbeauty.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jonesroadbeauty.com/products/the-101-set?variant=40854385557654" data-vars-ga-product-id=b6cabc1f-b359-47cb-bd11-aac55d749cf6 data-vars-ga-product-price=$96.90 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=8a5dde0b-ae79-47d6-b9a1-c4e3dc80011f data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=40854385557654 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="The 101 Set Your New Favorites" title="The 101 Set Your New Favorites" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1636404201-jonesroad-mb-fp-mascara-bundle-01-4f7a8b60-5d6c-412e-8cab-b8d73aff5ed3-750x1000-crop-centerat2x-1636404190.jpg width=1230 height=1600 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">The 101 Set Your New Favorites</h2></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even without the forced circumstances of the looming pandemic, the necessary trappings for a successful start-up that provides its audience with more than just product, but also connection, inspiration, and guidance, are all there: Jones Road’s site reveals easy, scratch pad-like breakdowns of scores of achievable makeup looks, shown on models of all races and ages. “I’ve always been a visual storyteller. I want Jones Road to teach and empower,” Brown nods. Accessibility has always been a component of her magic. Every beauty editor seems to have her own personal Bobbi Brown story, while Brown herself frequently appears throughout Jones Road’s social media offering personal tips and instruction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And now with an inaugural brick-and-mortar opening, guests at the physical outpost might even have their own Bobbi Brown “moments,” so to speak. Along with the complete collection—which will expand to 40 products by the end of November—there to see and try out in person, Brown hopes to schedule events and instructional programming in the near future. “It’s so nice, because it’s in my backyard, so I’ll be able to hang there,” she says.<br></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqaZm5rCsXvAbG9qcWFmgXd7waiZm6Fdl7%2Bww81moaimlah6s7vAnWSsrJ%2Bnsm61za2cq66ZmsRw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
