We saw a lot of synergy between the two brands and our aesthetic approach,” Atkin tells StyleCaster.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Powered by natural detoxifying and volumizing ingredients like volcanic minerals and rice starch, the brand’s original (and super beloved) <a href=# rel=noopener>oil-absorbing dry shampoo</a> was a no-brainer when it came to choosing the right product to collaborate on for both Atkin and Gorham. “It made sense to create a hybrid of the two products that seem to be such a cult favorite for both OUAI and <span class=mark26owp8vqb>Byredo. [You] get the benefit of a dry shampoo while smelling like this chic, expensive perfume was obviously such a win,” Atkin says. Um, agreed.</span></p><p><span class=mark26owp8vqb>And yes, while the O.G. formula definitely revives musty, day-three hair smelling fresh and lightly-fragranced after a few spritzes, but this haircare-perfume hybrid leaves your locks smelling like straight-up luxury. As a longtime Byredo lover, Atkin decided to go with her own signature scent for the collab, Mojave Ghost. “It’s</span> been in my fragrance collection for years—it truly is the dreamiest scent.” For those who haven’t had the pleasure of getting a whiff of the woody fragrance, it features base notes of Cedarwood, Crisp Amber, and Chantilly Musk, culminating in a complex, yet universally-palatable composition.</p><p>Of course, the OUAI x Byredo dry shampoo is also formulated with the original’s revolutionary oil-absorbing and texturizing properties, so it’s definitely *not* just a hair perfume. I mean, it even protects your hair and scalp from free radical damage. “The volcanic minerals help to naturally cleanse the hair and detox it starting at the root, so your hair does actually feel cleaner, it’s not just a bandaid, [while] the Rhodiola Rosea extract helps to fight free radicals which help hair appear stronger and healthier.” Talk about a multifunctional beauty product.</p><p><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
