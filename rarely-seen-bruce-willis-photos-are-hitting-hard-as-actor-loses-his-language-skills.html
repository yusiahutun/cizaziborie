The <a href=#>celebrity</a> has removed himself from the spotlight following complications with the condition.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tallulah-is-so-proud-to-be-bruce-willis-daughter>Tallulah is ‘so proud’ to be Bruce Willis’ daughter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1180531961.jpg><p>Tallulah went on social media to share the pictures with the world. Bruce Willis shares his daughter with ex-wife <a href=#>Demi Moore</a>, they also share Rumer, 35, and Scout, 32.</p><p>Posting the photos of her <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star dad, Tallulah penned: “Damn, these photos are hitting tonight. You’re my whole damn heart, and I’m so proud to be your Tallulah Belle Bruce Willis.”</p><p>Fans took to the comments to share their thoughts on the pair’s daughter-dad bond, as well as sharing their own experiences with the heartbreaking diagnosis.</p><p>“Very sweet! Amazing bond, it’s obvious and beautiful,” one person wrote.</p><p>Another said: “I’m going through something not too dissimilar with my father, and sometimes it is tough to look back on the past, but just remember how great it was.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong><a href=#>Demi Moore looks sensational in bold swimsuit while sunbathing in ‘paradise’</a></p><p>A third commented: “I don’t have a relationship with my dad, I learned he had dementia in 2019. I love seeing your family grow and come together in love for your father. Give him a hug from me.”</p><p>“You’re always his girl…you carry him & his love that transcends everything…big hug TBBW,” a fourth said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-not-totally-verbal>“He’s not totally verbal”</h2><p>Last year, Bruce retired from making <a href=#>movies</a> and TV shows to focus on coping with his aphasia. It is a condition that makes it increasingly difficult for those with it to communicate verbally. Then, earlier this year, <a href=#>his family announced</a> that the Die Hard actor had Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD).</p><p>Glenn Gordon Caron, creator of the drama series Moonlighting, in which Bruce had a main role, revealed that Bruce no longer had “joie de vivre.”</p><p>He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a>: “My sense is the first one to three minutes he knows who I am. He’s not totally verbal; he used to be a voracious reader – he didn’t want anyone to know that – and he’s not reading now.”</p><p>He continued by saying he is “still Bruce” despite “all those language skills no longer being available to him.</p><p>“When you’re with him, you know that he’s Bruce, and you’re grateful that he’s there, but the joie de vivre is gone,” he added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-wife-feels-guilty-in-heartbreaking-update>His wife feels guilty in heartbreaking update</h2><p><a href=#>Bruce’s wife, Emma Hemming,</a> 45, with whom he shares his two youngest children, daughters Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, nine, wrote an op-ed about the struggles and effects it has on those around a person with conditions like dementia.</p><p>She wrote for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Maria Shriver’s Sunday Paper</a> that it “isn’t lost” on her that they have “resources” that others do not.</p><p>“I struggle with guilt, knowing that I have resources that others don’t,” she wrote.</p><p>“When I’m able to get out for a hike to clear my head, it’s not lost on me that not all care partners can do that. When what I share about our family’s journey gets press attention, I know that there are many thousands of untold, unheard stories, each of them deserving of compassion and concern.”</p><p>She continued by saying that her husband’s high profile allows for others in the same position to “feel seen and understood.”</p><p>“I want people to know that when I hear from another family affected by FTD, I hear our family’s same story of grief, loss, and immense sadness echoed in theirs. It’s important to me to be an advocate on behalf of those families who don’t have the time, energy, or resources to advocate for themselves.”</p><p>She concluded by writing: “I have so much more hope today than I did after Bruce was first diagnosed. I understand this disease more now, and I’m now connected to an incredible community of support.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher was ruled by jealousy when it came to Bruce Willis and Demi Moore</a></p><p>🤍<strong></strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aCcL7Aq5ylsV2osqa6jJuprpuVYsSquMuiqmaomKTBsL%2BMmqmeZZiewbW1zaBkoZmimXqiv4yamq2nomK5sL%2FErGShoaNiuaK6xq6YoJ1dqLiquMusZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
