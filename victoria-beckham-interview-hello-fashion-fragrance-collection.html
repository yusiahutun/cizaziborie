Fragrances are so personal, but it was instant working with Jérôme, when we landed on the right collection of notes to portray each memory.</p><p id=edZXQu0Xqeo data-wc=8><strong>Was there a lot of back and forth?</strong></p><p id=eOKpSEnPSJG data-wc=56>I spent a lot of time with Jérôme in Paris and New York, and on Zoom, getting to know him and telling him what I liked. He is such an incredible perfumer. And he got to know me, I spent time sharing stories with him, for us to find a way to capture them as scents.</p><p id=eEvGwZ3uOk data-wc=11><strong>MORE: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Here's why Victoria Beckham's contour hack is worth a try</a></p><p id=e8eFEUD9pAQ data-wc=13><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Victoria Beckham's black midi dress and fishnet combo is perfect for autumn</a></strong></p><p id=ekLIcOYbqwr data-wc=12><strong>Your skin is glowing. Can you talk us through your skincare routine?</strong></p><p id=eHqL8uULcmx data-wc=85>My skin is my base. I try to avoid heavy foundation and concealer and instead. I really work at making my complexion the best it can be. For me this starts with skincare: I use the Sarah Chapman Ultimate Cleanse and then drench my face in VB x Augustinus Bader Cell Rejuvenating Power Serum. It's like a drink for my skin. I've noticed such a difference since using it, in terms of fine lines around my eyes. Then I apply the Augustinus Bader Rich Cream.</p><p id=eCm40U7bdwO data-wc=6><strong>What treatments do you swear by?</strong></p><p id=eTiUaUAyvzF data-wc=10>I go to Melanie Grant and Sarah Chapman for facials.</p><p id=esIAp95NpV7 data-wc=5><strong>What's your favourite make-up look?</strong></p><p id=efgerUw2dP4 data-wc=47>I adore a smoky eye. In the daytime, this is a brown smoky eye, and then at night or for an occasion, I may add Olive or Navy using my Satin Kajal Liner pencils. And I always wear Instant Brightening Waterline Pencil to open up my eyes.</p><p id=eddQPBl_ppI data-wc=9><strong>How do you come up with the shade names?</strong></p><p id=e_65BYPXaU2i data-wc=98>We have fun coming up with them - they all have unique stories. Harper was the inspiration behind our Cheeky Posh Cream Blush Stick in Rollerskate. I was with my product development team in Miami and she was roller skating. She went to her room and pulled out this bright pink shade. It looked scary, but it planted the idea of creating a vivid pink that gives you a fresh glow instantly. It's such a fun and youthful shade. I like to pop it on when I'm running out of the house or just heading to the gym</p><p id=eIqAuJjPHklj data-wc=6><strong>What's your favourite trend for AW23?</strong></p><p id=eLHcM2aHGVeJ data-wc=37>I think we took such a fresh approach to colour around the eyes at my show, using Victoria Beckham Beauty EyeWear in Macaron and Sunflower.
