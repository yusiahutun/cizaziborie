The southern Spanish city is often considered the hub of flamenco culture, and I grew up hearing flamenco singers—from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKtAhJPZS6o" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Camarón de la Isla" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Camarón de la Isla</a> to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18B-PCxhm5Q" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="La Niña de los Peines" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">La Niña de los Peines</a> to the local cantaora at the nearby tablao—but I had never heard anything like that.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I went back home to New York that August in 2018, I tried to explain Rosalía to my friends. This was before anyone outside of Spain knew who she was, and the best way to express how she was remixing a centuries-old genre was actually by pointing at her chunky white sneakers. She wore them religiously to perform flamenco golpes (stomps), styled with crop tops covered in enormous ruffles, like deconstructed flamenco gowns cut up. Even then, her fashion sense conveyed her total project.<br></p><img alt="miami, florida august 30 rosalia performs live on stage during the spotify ¡viva latino live on august 30, 2019 in miami, florida photo by alexander tamargogetty images for spotify" title="Spotify ¡Viva Latino!

When she took the stage at Coachella for two weekends in April, she emerged from behind 40 dancers in motorcycle helmets. They parted as she walked out from behind them, her Harley-Davidson helmet lit up with pigtails attached to the shell. The loose pieces of her custom Acne Studios top (in pink for weekend one, black for weekend two) flowed with the desert wind, encircling her like Medusa’s snakes, her audience suspended like stone. “Una mariposa, yo me transformo,” she snarled: A butterfly, I transform.</p><img alt="indio, california april 15 rosalía performs at the coachella stage during the 2023 coachella valley music and arts festival on april 15, 2023 in indio, california photo by frazer harrisongetty images for coachella" title="2023 Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival - Weekend 1 - Day 2" width=2833 height=4250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rosalia-coachella-2-644192f873805.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Frazer Harrison</span><p>Rosalía performing at Coachella in Rick Owens shield sunglasses and a custom cascade of sheer pink ruffles by Acne Studios</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rosalía’s set reminded everyone why she is a once-in-a-generation talent. It’s her velvet voice, hypnotic and classically trained. It’s her contradicting choreography of fierce floreos and teasing twerks. It’s her makeup, wiped off completely with a towel mid-performance so when she brings herself to tears later—as she often does—you can really see her duende in the wetness of her lashes and the redness of her cheeks. And it’s the fit of ruffles, the oversize Rick Owens shield sunglasses, the boots she can somehow dance in for over an hour. It’s the totality of her vision, fully realized through what she wears.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her wardrobe has always transmitted the unwavering confidence of someone who knows who they are. Even as she raps about the metamorphosis of butterflies and drag queen makeup in “Saoko,” from her 2022 concept album, Motomami, she still says that ultimately, “Yo soy muy mía” (“I’m very much me”).</p><img alt="new york, ny april 30 rosalia performs at webster hall on april 30, 2019 in new york city photo by taylor hillgetty images" title="Rosalia In Concert - New York City" width=2400 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rosalia-webster-hall-644192842c4d6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Taylor Hill</span><p>Rosalía at New York City’s Webster Hall in 2019, wearing a I.Am.Gia patent set in a deep fiery red, the preferred color of flamenco performers</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2018, when Rosalía released El Mal Querer, the critically acclaimed second album that turned her from a flamenco prodigy into a global superstar, her wardrobe was entrenched in her roots. The album was inspired by the anonymous 13th-century Occitan novel Flamenca, about a woman imprisoned by her husband, and in the accompanying music videos, she wore elements from a typical flamenco costume—the color red, engulfing ruffles, large gold sevillana earrings—modernized through nontraditional styling with those chunky sneakers, velour tracksuits, and long acrylic nails that she snapped together with a flick of her wrist, as one would a castanet. Her performance wardrobe for the tour followed the same formula. When I saw her sold-out show at Webster Hall in early 2019, she wore a patent red two-piece set from I.Am.Gia. which recalled the fiery intensity of a traje de flamenca but was built for the streets of New York.</p><img alt="new york, new york september 18 rosalia performs onstage during her motomami tour at radio city music hall on september 18, 2022 in new york city photo by kevin mazurgetty images" title="Rosalia Motomami Tour - New York" width=3000 height=4500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1425051719-64419443aeae6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kevin Mazur</span><p>On her Motomami World Tour tour, Rosalía wore a custom Dion Lee motorcycle set with platform knee-high boots and oversize sunglasses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then came Motomami, her third album. Rosalía doubled down on her reputation as a metamorphosing sonic collagist with songs like “Hentai,” an erotic ballad whose lyrics “Te quiero ride / Como a mi bike” (“I want to ride you like my bike”) sound achingly beautiful because they’re raw and palpable and maybe something you’d actually say. With the new album came another visual transformation that didn’t necessarily feel like a revamp, but was a slight shift away from her more literal “not your abuela’s flamenco” reinterpretation of the genre.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When asked—by both <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/latin/rosalia-motomami-interview-1235047442/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Billboard class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Billboard</u></a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkOMIsEen1g&t=127s" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jimmy Fallon" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Jimmy Fallon</u></a>—to define what exactly motomami means, Rosalía answered simply: “It’s an energy.” The term originated from a friend’s old email address, but resonated because when the singer was a child in the industrial Spanish town of Sant Cugat del Vallès, she would ride around on the back of her mom’s motorcycles. “My mom is the OG motomami,” she often says when asked about the album title.</p><img alt="new york, new york september 18 rosalia performs onstage during her motomami tour at radio city music hall on september 18, 2022 in new york city photo by kevin mazurgetty images" title="Rosalia Motomami Tour - New York" width=3001 height=4500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1425059187-6441948a7ed05.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kevin Mazur</span><p>At Radio City Music Hall in New York, Rosalía wears the same custom Dion Lee set, with details reminiscent of butterfly wings, a motif from her Motomami album.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A year before the Motomami World Tour started, Rosalía and her sister Pilar, who serves as her creative director, tapped designer Dion Lee to turn this abstract energy into an aesthetic for the stage. On the Motomami album cover she poses nude with long white nails serving as censor bars, an oversize motorcycle helmet obscuring her face and her long pigtails overflowing from the sides; Lee just had to figure out the rest.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I asked him over email if it had been hard, he said the challenge made him “excited and extremely nervous,” but that despite his trepidation, it was still, somehow, straightforward. “There was already such an established visual with Motomami,” he wrote. “Rosalía’s energy, the lyrics, and the visual identity were all a rich source of inspiration.”</p><img alt="a coruna, spain july 29 singer rosalía performs during the motomami world tour at coliseum a coruña on july 29, 2022 in a coruna, spain photo by cristina andinaredferns" title="Rosalia Concert In A Coruña" width=3000 height=4500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1411720790-6441946c3bb8b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Cris Andina</span><p>Rosalía wearing a full custom Dion Lee look for a Motomami concert in A Coruña, Spain.

In the music video for the track, Rosalía wears a red draped dress while drowning in a pool of motor oil, then changes into assless chaps and a bolero jacket constructed from a leather biker jacket for aggressive, knee-jerking choreo.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When asked to define motomami himself, Lee says: “It represents the hard and the soft. The masculine and the feminine. Aggression and vulnerability.”</p><img alt="toronto, ontario september 23 rosalía performs at budweiser stage on september 23, 2022 in toronto, ontario photo by jeremychanphotographygetty images" title="Rosalia Performs At Budweiser Stage" width=2976 height=4464 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1426752643-6441949e115ec.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeremychanphotography</span><p>“I love contemporary dance and have collaborated with choreographers in the past. However, designing for a world tour was a completely different experience,” Dion Lee says of the custom sets he created for Rosalía’s Motomami World Tour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ultimately, he created 10 complete looks in different colorways, all cycled through for different cities. When I saw one of Rosalía’s first Motomami World Tour shows in Sevilla, Spain, she wore a simple asymmetrical white dress cut high on one side and tall red moto boots. In New York she appeared at Radio City Music Hall in a white cutout bodysuit worn under a cropped leather motorcycle jacket with enormous shoulders and a matching miniskirt, the contrasting leather white and black details evoking the image of butterfly wings. A fan favorite was a deep blue bodysuit with bulky black shoulder pads and a pleated schoolgirl skirt with two belts fastened at her hips.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The Motomami aesthetic felt like it had a total grip on the world during Rosalía’s tour,” Lee says. There were still some nods to flamenco, too; when she performed “De Plata,” a song from her more traditional first album, Los Ángeles, a group of dancers clipped the train of an enormous black flamenco dress to her skirt.</p><img alt="seville, spain july 09 rosalia performs during the motomami tour at la cartuja de sevilla stadium on july 09, 2022 in seville, spain photo by taylor hillredferns" title="Rosalia Concert In Seville" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1408147956-648323d4e831c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Taylor Hill</span><p>Rosalía performing “De Plata,” from her first album, Los Ángeles, in a long ruffled flamenco skirt, attached to her outfit by backup dancers. It is the only time her outfit changes during her Motomami set.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unlike the other two major tours happening right now, Beyoncé’s Renaissance and Taylor Swift’s Eras, the Motomami World Tour doesn’t involve multiple outfit changes. With the exception of the clipped-on ruffle train, which feels more like a flourish than anything, Rosalía stays in one look each night.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beyoncé’s ability to turn out custom looks from the biggest fashion houses in the world proves she’s the queen who can transcend the runway, and Swift’s sentimental fits of sequins and shimmer build a nostalgic visual playground for her fans. But Rosalía’s decision to stick to a fairly consistent look doesn’t feel like either a statement or a rejection of the typical pop-star need for constant reinvention. It’s more like she knows who she is, so why mess with it?<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Motomami is an energy, which is how she’s been able to build a fan base with people who don’t understand a single word she says. Dressing like a motomami isn’t a costume; it’s a uniform, a pledge. Instead of molding herself into the traditional tropes of what a pop star should look like, she’s written her own script—quite literally: Rosalía has worked with a stylist on only a handful of occasions. Whereas other artists strive to meet the terms of their fashion contracts or impress a younger audience by wearing what they think will dazzle, Rosalía’s wardrobe feels authentic. It’s how she sees herself, not how she wants us to see her.</p><img alt="sao paulo, brazil march 26 rosalía performs live on stage during the closing day of lollapalooza brazil at autodromo de interlagos on march 26, 2023 in sao paulo, brazil photo by mauricio santanagetty images" title="Lollapalooza Brazil 2023 - Day 3" width=3385 height=5078 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1476854055-644194fa882d3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mauricio Santana</span><p>At Lollapalooza in Brazil, Rosalía notably changed up her stage look, donning a custom catsuit and corset by Acne Studios.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This month, she’s kicking off a tour of the European festival circuit. For her largest audience yet, she enlisted Jonny Johansson of Acne Studios to custom-make all of her looks. So far those include red and blue gingham dresses gathered at the hip (slightly altered from a pink version that appeared on the spring 2023 runway), a series of catsuits worn under corsets with floral metal detailing, and her delicate cascading ruffle Coachella tops with patent leather pants, all styled with knee-high platform boots.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The looks feel one part El Mal Querer and one part Motomami, the culmination of the distinct soft cultural and tough urban elements that have come to define her. The decision to do something different for these massive shows—attended by many concertgoers who come to watch her set out of curiosity rather than devotion—feels as intentional as anything else Rosalía does. It’s an introduction for new listeners and a reminder for old fans; it’s everything she’s ever been, distilled in a look that feels genuine onstage.</p><img alt="indio, california april 15 rosalía performs at the coachella stage during the 2023 coachella valley music and arts festival on april 15, 2023 in indio, california photo by frazer harrisongetty images for coachella" title="2023 Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival - Weekend 1 - Day 2" width=2346 height=3519 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1482539468-644195071f393.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Frazer Harrison</span><p>Another look at her Coachella outfit</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Every night before her encore, Rosalía’s last song is “Sakura,” a pensive ballad named for the ephemeral cherry blossom. To the sound of only a keyboard, she belts, “Ser una popstar nunca te dura / Flor de sakura, flor de sakura / No me da pena, me da ternura” (“Being a pop star never lasts / Cherry blossom, cherry blossom / It doesn’t make me sad, it makes me feel tender”). In interviews, she often talks about how she knows her moment is fleeting, how the album that made her career was actually a thesis project, how she never expected to be here. And the image she is creating, the one people will remember, is not of a typical pop star offering a flashy fashion feast, but of an artist who created her own world—and then dressed the part.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
