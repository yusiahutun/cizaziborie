Even though each relationship has had its fair share of ups and downs, there are so many memorable couples to choose from, including <a href=#>Paul Newman</a> and <a href=#>Joanne Woodward</a>; <strong><a href=#>Kurt Russell</a></strong> and <a href=#><strong>Goldie Hawn</strong></a>; and many more.</p><p>When looking back on all the iconic relationships, it’s important to highlight the special love story fans got to see it unfold — in a fictional sense — every week on TV. We’re talking about <a href=#>Lucille Ball</a> and <a href=#>Desi Arnaz</a>, of course, the stars of <a href=#>I Love Lucy</a> who were married from 1940 until 1960.</p><p>Many grew up watching them on the small screen — both in the ’50s as well as in reruns still airing today — with their hilarious antics that delivered too many laughs to count. Their love was just as electric off screen, and during their 20-year marriage, they became the loving parents of their real-life kids, <strong>Desi Arnaz Jr</strong>. and <strong>Lucie Arnaz</strong>. Though the two eventually split, their romance is remembered as one of the most legendary.</p><p>Unlike Luci and Dezi, there are some other couples who are still together today, including <a href=#><strong>Tom Hanks</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Rita Wilson</strong></a>, as well as Kurt and Goldie. Both duos are iconic in their own right, with Tom and Rita showing us that marriages in Hollywood can last. As for the Overboards alum, Kurt and Goldie have proven you don’t even need to tie the knot to be soulmates.</p><p>“<a href=#>They’re both old hippies at heart</a> — neither of them feel that a piece of paper or a rabbi saying, ‘I now pronounce you …’ really matters,” a friend close to the decades-long pair told Closer Weekly in 2016. “Goldie’s thoughts are that if you want to keep your man for decades, like she has, you give them space to be men.”</p><p>All that said, there are plenty of duos from yesteryear who are considered to be some of the most beloved couples in all of Hollywood. They include Academy Award winners, legendary singers and some of the most attractive stars of their day. Trust us, you’re going to feel your heart fluttering when you find out more about these red-hot romances.</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see 10 of Hollywood’s most memorable love stories of all time.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v45qZ2afopqutbHSrWShp5yhxri7zp1kpaemmnq0wM6roJ6rXaiypnnToZxmpZ%2BowW61wqiloptdmLy2vMueqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
