According to reports, the comedian Carey met Dominic Cooper through his “The History Boys” co-star. After Cooper introduced Corden to Carey, the two developed an interest in each other, began a romantic affair that lasted several years, and finally married in September 2012.</p><p>It is on record that the couple sealed the marriage in an elaborate £250,000 ceremony at Babington House in Somerset, attended by a number of prominent friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Julia-Carey.jpg><p>For Corden, Carey’s support is an important factor contributing to the success of his career.

The Corden family, who originally lived in the UK, had to move to the US after Corden appeared as the late-night host of CBS. He commented on the move:</p><p>“All credit to my wife who agreed to the move when our daughter was five weeks old and our son … three … The couple and their children currently live in a £19 million five-story mansion in Malibu.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Julia Carey Bio</strong></h2><p>Julia Carey is not quite as famous for her relationship with the English comedian. She’s much more than just James Corden’s wife.</p><p>In fact, Dominic Cooper, the English actor who introduced Corden to Carey, once explained that the love between Carey and Corden has remained strong because they have a lot in common. According to Cooper, Carey worked in television. Therefore, it is easy for her to identify with him as he is without her thinking Corden as a star is a big deal.</p><p>Julia Carey is an actress, television producer, and social worker.
