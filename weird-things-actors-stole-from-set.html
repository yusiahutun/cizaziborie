Although most stars opt for a small trinket or a piece of clothing, some prefer to pick out something a little more obscure and unexpected. From prosthetic arms to used underwear, these celebs admit that what they took from set may be considered a little weird. While their choices may not make sense to their fans, they're happy to bring home a keepsake that reminds them of their time spent on set.</p><p>Find out what these actors took from their movie and TV setsâ€¦</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0015b44b-a757-4eb6-a714-f115a235bef6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:366e75bd-769c-4470-8506-4f711fd8a6e3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/11/5by4/2024/03/21/11f1441d15694e5591ca86e5c6074d55_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Warner Bros.</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice Trailer: The Juice Is Loose as Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder Return</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=#><strong>Will Ferrell</strong></a></p><p>Will Ferrell walked away from the set of Step Brothers with something pretty unusual -- the prosthetic testicles he used in the film. While the prop tends to weird some people out, Will says he likes showing them off at dinner parties.</p><p>"They're life-like and I have brought these out, much to the horror [of many]. At many a dinner party, I presented these. These fake testicles are what was put on Brennan's drum kit," Will explained on <a href=#><strong>The Graham Norton Show</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>2.</strong><a href=#><strong> Aaron Paul</strong></a></p><p>Aaron Paul admits that he stole quite a lot from the set of Breaking Bad including the prosthetic head used when Gus Fring got blown up. While the prop is a little bit gross, Aaron says he's happy to have it -- and even shared a photo of it on Instagram.</p><p>"Well, this is what it looks like," Aaron captioned <a href=#><strong>the photo of the head</strong></a><strong>.</strong> "Also, if you are not caught up on Breaking Bad guess what...Gus's face blows up.ðŸ’£ðŸ’£ðŸ’£ðŸ’£ðŸ’£ Love to you all.

He says he was given the "bloody thong" that he wore while filming the nude fight scene at the end of the movie.</p><p>"It wasn't a choice, it was a gift. That's how much they valued my performance, my contribution to this movie," he said in<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</strong></a>. "It's the g-string that I wore. The end fight takes place on an erupting volcano and we're naked â€¦ So, that's what I wore for a week, and my character's quite wounded so he's bleeding a lot profusely."</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Dakota Johnson</strong></a></p><p>Dakota Johnson admits that she also walked away from a set with underwear!

While it may have seemed weird at the time, he actually used it to create custom wooden paddles for people who worked on the show.</p><p>"Nick Offerman salvaged the wood from the Parks and Rec set and made us all canoe paddles with it.

After filming wrapped, the car was actually stolen but it was later abandoned when its notoriety made it hard for the thieves to sell. Rupert eventually gained possession of the car and it's gone on to <a href=#><strong>be displayed in museums</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>10. </strong><a href=#><strong>Norman Reedus</strong></a></p><p>Norman Reedus has a collection of bizarre items he's acquired from filming The Walking Dead -- and show boss Greg Nicotero has even helped him add to the collection. As for some of the weirdest items, Norman says he has hair clippings from some of his co-stars.</p><p>"I've got Herschel's hair -- I've got his ponytail.
