Sort of.</p><p>It wasn't a&nbsp;premeditated co-write, but rather a moment of inspiration that joined the two together. Brice's preacher, Pete Wilson, is the author of the book&nbsp;What Keeps You Up at Night?: How to Find Peace While Chasing Your Dreams; the title moved Brice so much, he started working on a song with the same title, "What Keeps You Up at Night," for his new album.</p><p>"The book wasn’t out yet and [Wilson] was going to have a book release party," Brice tells Taste of Country. "When he said the title of the book is What Keeps You Up at Night,&nbsp;that title stuck in my head, so I went and wrote the song. I knew it came out special immediately. In fact, it was the foundation of this record."</p><p>Brice said he later called Wilson and added him as a co-writer of the song because it was his title.&nbsp;Brice and Wilson also share credits with Ross Copperman and Jessi Alexander on the song.</p><p>The new 15-track album contains 11 songs co-written by Brice, including&nbsp;"Songs in the Kitchen" and "Have a Good Day," two of Brice's favorite&nbsp;tracks on the album. Brice has also penned a number of his hit songs such as "<a href=#>I Don't Dance</a>" and "<a href=#>Parking Lot Party</a>," while earning outside cuts with&nbsp;major artists such as&nbsp;<a href=#>Garth Brooks</a>, <a href=#>Tim McGraw</a> and The <a href=#>Eli Young Band</a>.</p><p><strong>Country Music's Most Adorable Couples</strong></p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: Listen to the 100 Best Country Love Songs</a><p><strong>We Promise You’ve Never Seen a Cover Quite Like This!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpZ2VYq%2BztcKeZKynnpx6uLXToWSpqpWWsKmx0Wg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
