(The last was in late May and early June.) As the sun wraps up its stint in mysterious, magical fixed water sign Scorpio, a full moon will sit in its opposite sign, fixed earth sign Taurus, kicking off a whole new cycle of eclipses through the second and the eighth signs of the zodiac that lasts into late 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This game-changing event, which will be exact on November 19 at 3:58 a.m. ET/12:58 a.m. PT, will push the release of anything that's no longer serving you so that you can more readily make space for the building blocks of a more deeply fulfilling, security-bolstering life.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-full-moon-in-taurus-delivers-big-changes-around-love-money-and-self-worth></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The full moon in Taurus delivers big changes around love, money, and self-worth.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Full moons — which happen when the confident sun opposes the security-seeking moon — are culmination points when we often reach the finish line on goals or find that a particular relationship or undertaking has run its course. In other words, it's about endings that have to happen in order for us to make room for beginnings, which is undoubtedly full of swimming in big feelings and often requires tuning into and applying your intuition.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And when a full moon is accompanied by a lunar eclipse — which happens when the earth sits between the sun and the moon and casts a shadow over la luna — the emotional ante around all of that is amped up. The energy of the moment is often extremely intense and possibly even overwhelming. All of these elements of a full moon and lunar eclipse come together to create a powerful change-making brew.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With this month's astrological event falling in down-to-earth, sensual, security-focused Taurus — ruled by the planet of love Venus — shake-ups are most likely to be tied to romantic relationships, money, and self-worth.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-square-to-jupiter-only-serves-to-magnify-the-eclipses-theme></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A square to Jupiter only serves to magnify the eclipse's theme.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the main aspects this Taurus full moon and lunar eclipse makes is a square to Jupiter, the planet of fortune. That sounds fairly benevolent, but Jupiter's the planet of "go big or go home," bringing an exaggerating effect to everything it comes in contact with, so whatever the takeaway of this event is for you will only be bolded, italicized, and underlined by Jupiter. (More on that particular takeaway in a bit.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jupiter's effect could also have us believing more is better — even if that couldn't be further from the truth. For instance, you could be tempted to put work on the backburner or indulge a little more than usual only to have to deal with the consequences — the intensity of which could be ratcheted up by the eclipse — later on.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mercury-blurs-our-thinking-and-communication></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mercury blurs our thinking and communication.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>most recent Mercury retrograde</a> in the rearview, you probably thought you were through the worst of this vibe. Bad news: Because the messenger planet is sitting opposite the moon during this eclipse, we'll have less clarity and more confusion, which could lead to a war of words. Because both Mercury and the moon are moving through fixed — aka stubborn — signs, they're fueling a tendency to dig your heels in and declare, "I said what I said." This could of course be applause-worthy if you're taking a stand on something worthy of commitment, but could very well be problematic if the situation calls for embracing a more open-minded point of view.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-t-square-among-mars-uranus-and-saturn-cranks-up-the-potential-for-fiery-frustrating-twists-and-turns></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A T-square among Mars, Uranus, and Saturn cranks up the potential for fiery, frustrating twists and turns.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On the eclipse day, Mars, the planet of anger, in Scorpio, Uranus, the planet of rebellion, in Taurus, and Saturn, the planet of restriction, in Aquarius form a T-square. A T-square happens when three planets square one another and create a helluva lot of tension which, in the case of these particular three clashings, could result in sudden aggression, fiery showdowns, and/or fury-inducing frustration. On the flipside, squares can be activating and push us toward — yup, you guessed it, more change. So the more you can accept that you're on a choppy ride and have the ability to breathe through it, the smoother you could expect sailing to be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My mentor, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>April Elliott Kent</a>, who happens to be an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>eclipse wizard</a>, always says that the best way to deal with T-squares is to zero in on and embrace the energy of the sign that's missing from the square. In this case, all fixed signs are represented except for fixed fire sign Leo. So the "escape route" of this particular aspect is to adopt a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Leo</a> perspective, which is creative, confident, optimistic, and outgoing. Ruled by the sun, buoyant Leo believes everything has a way of working out, and given the restrictions you might be facing around this T-square, trying that perspective on for size could be truly beneficial. You might find you can work through eclipse stress best by pouring your energy into a self-expressive project, prioritizing a playful activity with friends or a romantic partner, or enjoying some lionesque lazing around with your human or fur kid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, how this Taurus full moon and lunar eclipse will affect you, based on your sign.
