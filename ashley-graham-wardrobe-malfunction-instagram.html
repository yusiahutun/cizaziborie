Her expression is one of pure shock and struggle. We feel you, girl. “We all have those days, today was mine,” Graham wrote. Yes. A thousand times yes. “This is what happens to most of my fittings,” she added on her Instagram story.</p><p>Fans are laughing and agreeing that they understand what the model is dealing with.</p><p>“Pretty sure my whole life is in this phase, like, permanently,” one follower wrote.</p><p>“😂 this is why you’re my role model.. 😂😂,” @ferguson.902_xo&nbsp;commented. Exactly.</p><p>Another Instagram user offered up a complement: “@ashleygraham still working those angles and looking good at the same time! 😉 📸 xx”</p><p>“Struggle, but make it fashion 😂,” someone else added.</p><p>So what is it that Graham is trying to get on? One user offered their opinion saying, “Does anyone else think this is pantyhose? I can’t wait to see photos of the attempt to get this off!!”</p><p>Another user added, “it looks like you’re being captured by aliens.” (We have a lot of questions if that’s what an alien capture looks like…)</p><p>But most opted for the laughing face emoji— gets the point across.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ashley-graham-instagram-comments.png><p>Hey—it’s good to laugh at yourself sometimes. And Graham is showing us exactly what that looks like. Her Instagram is proof.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHCFmG5wbXBflsCpuMSyZKCqkZ2urnnWmqmdqp%2BXsm65wKWdrqaTqbawuoyipayskZy%2FormO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
