Even if they never act on their feelings, they refuse to deny the affection they have for their closest confidante. Through the ebb and flow of time, these folks carry the torch of love for their besties, choosing to nourish and sustain this bond with care and loyalty. Take a sneak peek at who they are:</p><p>Aquarians form strong attachments to their loved ones and their best friend is no exception. They feel that their closest ally acts as a safe harbor, allowing them to be their true selves without any fear. In the embrace of such a friendship, Aquarians are likely to feel acceptance, support, validation, and even love. As a result, they may wish to turn the platonic connection into a romantic one that lasts a lifetime. Should the love be mutual, these Water-bearers (the symbol of Aquarius) experience a wonderful relationship. But if the spark of romance refuses to ignite in their bestie’s heart, Aquarians do not give up on their feelings. <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>They tend to offer their mate unconditional affection that burns bright even in the darkest of times.
