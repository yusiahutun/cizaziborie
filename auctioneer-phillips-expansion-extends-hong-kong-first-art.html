Phillips, the 220-year-old London auction house that is expanding internationally under Russian ownership, is to hold its first major sales in Hong Kong in spite of continuing macroeconomic uncertainties that may curb collectors’ enthusiasm.
Phillips’ chairman and CEO Ed Dolman said the art market was “extremely resilient” and that Hong Kong would remain one of “the main art markets in the world” despite “softness” in the Chinese economy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Since then, Phillips has expanded its offices in London and New York and is now trying to secure a larger share of the 20th-century and contemporary art and design auction market, its forte. Its Asian headquarters opened last summer in The Landmark in Central, and to date it has held two watch sales in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Phillips’ evening sale in Hong Kong on November 27 is to feature an international mix of lots reflective of current Asian tastes, Dolman said. The inclusion of both Asian and Western paintings, photographs and design pieces is a break with what most auction houses in Hong Kong did in the past, which was focus on selling Asian art, jewellery, watches, wine and handbags.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/09/15/33b95ce8-7aed-11e6-aba3-c12eb464ff87_486x.JPG?itok=iGlT1bFI"><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Phillips is also slated to hold jewellery and watch sales in the city on November 28 and 29.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gerhard Richter’s Abstraktes Bild 776-1 (1992), estimated at HK$18 million to HK$25 million before buyer’s premium, is to come under the hammer at the November 27 sale. Richter, one of the most celebrated living artists in Europe, has many Asian collectors, and they have helped drive up the prices of his works in recent years. In October, Sotheby’s will auction another Richter in a special sale curated by K-pop megastar T.O.P., who is a fan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The same sale is to feature a photograph by Nick Knight, the legendary British fashion photographer who directed the video for Lady Gaga’s Born This Way. Sander (1992), shot for a Jil Sander campaign, is valued at HK$420,000 to HK$620,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other sale highlights include a work by groundbreaking American furniture designer Wendell Castle. His Ghost Rider (2010) features a seat shaped like a motorcycle and valued at HK$1 million to HK$1.5 million. Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Nets (1990), also on offer, is estimated at between HK$1.2 million and HK$1.8 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/09/15/35bbd4bc-7aed-11e6-aba3-c12eb464ff87_486x.JPG?itok=-5eFr0SP">The high-end art market has not been immune to the uncertainties created by the upcoming US presidential election, the recent UK vote for <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Brexit</span></a>, and China’s economic slowdown. The last European Fine Art Foundation annual report stated art sales were down 7 per cent last year from 2014, while a recent report by Artprice.com found a 25 per cent tumble in art sales over the first six months of the year.<p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Auction house to hammer uncertainty</p><img aria-label=loading data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLa4066pnmeRp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6tomaKptqS4xGhpaWlpa350e8Cumq2hn6Oypr6MqZ%2BipJyevbR5xLGnmqajnryvecSxq56mlKh6qbvNoGSkp56ceqe10ayrZpmiqQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
