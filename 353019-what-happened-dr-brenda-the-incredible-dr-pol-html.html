Dr. Brenda joined the cast of the series during the first episode of the first season, which aired on October 29, 2011. Even though Dr. Brenda on Dr. Pol show started with a focus on dairy animals, she gradually started treating smaller animals when dairy farms began to dwindle in the region.</p><p class=align-left>At the start of the show, Grettenberger mentioned that she enjoys working at Pol Veterinary Services with her colleagues.

Fans have been watching her consistently during the first eleven seasons, but from the 12th season, she stopped being a regular. So does this mean that Dr. Grettenberger left <i>The Incredible Dr. Pol</i>?</p><p class=align-left>Although many fans wondered what happened to Dr. Brenda on <i>The Incredible Dr. Pol</i>, Nat Geo did not give an official announcement. Dr. Brenda Grettenberger did not issue an official statement of her exit either. After the 12th season, she continued to receive show credits but was noticeably absent from the majority of the episodes.</p><p class=align-left>Of course, many fans knowing of her passion for being a veterinarian and a significant part of the show, brushed it off as something personal. However, her continued absence from the 12th season continued to raise eyebrows. The show remained a family affair between Dr. Pol and his wife.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4e7f08681081d668.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kate Norley: 10 quick facts to know about John Oliver's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Fans thought that Dr. Brenda Grettenberger was no longer interested in making television appearances, but she did not confirm her stance. So, where is Dr. Brenda on Dr. Pol? She is still one of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">staff members </a>at the Pol Veterinary Clinic.</p><p class=align-left>Dr. Pol's son, Charles, posted an appreciative tweet in which he said that he was lucky to have Dr. Brenda on the team because she was such a good vet. Fans were excited when she made a comeback on the screen, appearing in the 16th and subsequent seasons.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the episodes she has featured in include <i>Su-Pol Sized, Sprain, Sprain, Go Away, Supe-Pol-Stitiou, </i>and <i>Homeward Hound</i>. Dr. Brenda is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">scheduled to appear </a>in the 19th season, and she has no plans of leaving the show. Therefore, it seems the rumours about her departure from the series were completely fabricated as she remains an integral part of the Incredible Dr. Pol series.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b00559c9e22eb964.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cody Heller: The untold story of Dan Harmon's girlfriend</span></p></a><h2 id=353019-how-much-does-dr-brenda-make-per-episode class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>How much does Dr. Brenda make per episode?</h2><p class=align-left>Brenda has been working with Dr. Pol since 1992, and she must have made a vast fortune from the show that premiered in 2011. And there is not any doubt that a massive show like The Incredible Dr. Pol pays handsomely.</p><p class=align-left>Although her actual earnings mostly remain a mystery she earns a hefty pay. Handling animals comes with certain risks, and being on a TV show makes her display extremely valuable.</p><h2 id=353019-is-vet-brenda-on-dr-pol-married class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Is vet Brenda on Dr. Pol married?</h2><p class=align-left>Are you wondering about Dr. Brenda Grettenberger's husband?

A common inquiry among fans of the reality television series. The good news is that Dr. Brenda has not left the show, and she is working with Dr. Pol in the new season.

Dr Erin looked like she had a bright future in the show during the early days, but her fans were sad to learn that she had left the show.</p><p class=align-left>A few years ago, she was attached to experienced doctors as a staff member at Dr Jan Pol's veterinary clinic in Michigan. However, her appearance in the National Geographic Show was only limited to one episode. After that one episode in which she was an intern, it is not clear why she left and where she went to work.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FlGxnanFdrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnDq2SbqpWjsaJ506GcZqGemL%2BmsMibo55llKd6sbvLZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
