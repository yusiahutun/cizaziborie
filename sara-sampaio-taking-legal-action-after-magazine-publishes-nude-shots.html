While Sara is used to showing off her figure in lingerie or swimsuits for photoshoots, she is now alleging that editors at magazine Lui have published nude photos without her permission.</p><p id=e3KvS7l9Orz data-wc=87>"I had agreed to shoot the cover feature of Lui's autumn issue, under the condition that there was NO NUDITY. My agency and I insisted on having a clear agreement in place to protect myself in order to control the choice I made," she wrote on her Instagram page on Thursday night. "Even with the 'No Nudity' clause in my agreement with Lui, I was aggressively pressured to do nude shots on set, asking me why I didn't want to show my nipples or go fully nude."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8009a073e79c-sara-sampaio-nude-cover-z.jpg><p id=eOYw6Y6cUO-w data-wc=30>Sara claimed that throughout the shoot, she reiterated her boundaries and covered herself the best she could.

"Since the issue was released, I've been working with my agency to pursue legal action against Lui. What they did to me is unacceptable. I feel violated, mistreated and disrespected as a professional and as a woman. I want to do what I can to prevent this from happening to me again, and to others."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e19S00JHrXDf data-wc=50>Sara has been a vocal supporter of sexual abuse and harassment victims in recent weeks on her social media accounts, having picked up fellow model Cameron Russell's #myjobshouldnotincludeabuse campaign in a bid to encourage others traumatised by sexual misconduct to speak up and seek help rather than suffer in silence.</p><p id=e4Kcl-pi1FNp data-wc=70>To conclude her post, the brunette beauty stated that having posed nude in the past does not obligate her to do so again. "Just because I've consented to posing nude in the past, it does not give anyone the permission to assume I would do so again under any circumstance... It's my choice. And when I make that choice, I expect to be treated with respect and professionalism," she added.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
