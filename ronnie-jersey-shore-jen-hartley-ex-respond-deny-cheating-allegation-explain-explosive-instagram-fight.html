"We hadn't established a real relationship. My ex came back around. I had mixed feelings at the time. We just got out of a 4-year relationship."</p><p>As documented on the MTV <strong><a href=#>"Jersey Shore"</a></strong> revival, Ron and Jen's love story has never really been easy peasy. In fact, right around the time she gave birth, the two got into an <strong><a href=#>explosive fight on Instagram</a></strong>, which Jen revealed stemmed from her messy relationship with her ex.</p><p>"This is all part of the Instagram fight we got into because of this incident," she said. "When I came clean about this, he came clean about three times he hooked up with other girls in the same time period. We decided we wanted to be together and work though this and not to ever do it again."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ee6d6a74-9d02-55be-b4ae-a86e73704dd5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:a2e04c50-6201-5bce-9c37-2e0fd0604645 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/07/5by4/2018/05/09/07f0d6061f5254e0a7688d92f8d63264_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Jersey Shore' Tea-Shirt Time: JWoww Lectures Ronnie on Love, Fatherhood and 'Hoes' After Baby Mama's Awkward Visit</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>During the fight in question, Ronnie posted the following message to his Instagram Story: "Note to self: Can't turn a natural-born HO, into a HOUSEWIFE. If you find them in the gutter, leave them in the gutter." He followed that up with another post that read, "If your significant other keeps sex videos of their ex, shouldn't they show enough respect to delete them, esp. after being in a new relationship for over a year?" he asked, along with a Yes/No poll for fans to vote.</p><p>Jen responded to the craziness with an Instagram Story of her own, writing, "Can't turn a coke head into a father!" She followed that up with another post that read, "When your man goes all Rob Kardashian on you," accompanied by a laugh-cry emoji.</p><p>All the posts have since been deleted, but we have the receipts <strong><a href=#>here</a></strong>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2f618c30-91e8-5cab-a0d7-0e9e88581f7f data-container-ref=toofab:article:a2e04c50-6201-5bce-9c37-2e0fd0604645 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/de/5by4/2018/05/03/ded22f7a780753a5a3855e01f1de7562_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Mike 'The Situation' Sorrentino Calls Out Ronnie for 'Crossing the Line' on 'Jersey Shore: Family Vacation' (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Conveniently, Ronnie made sure to leave out the part of him also hooking up with other people when he told <strong><a href=#>Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Jenni "JWoww" Farley</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Deena Cortese</a></strong> on Thursday's episode that Jen was untrustworthy.</p><p>"I'm just more worried about me and Jen, to be honest with you," Ronnie said to the girls.
