Actress Took a Hiatus to Care for Her Ailing Dad</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-19</div><p>Actress <a href=#>Hilary Swank</a> recently returned to the limelight after a three-year Hollywood hiatus —&nbsp;and just revealed that she took a break from acting for a very good reason. During a Tuesday, March 20 appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the 43-year-old star opened up about her father, Stephen Swank, undergoing a life-saving lung transplant and provided fans with an update on her dad’s health today.</p><p>“He’s great, thank you for asking. For those of you who don’t know, my dad got a lung transplant. It’s the hardest surgery a person can undergo and I thank all the people that make themselves a donor, it saves lives,” Hilary <a href=#>told host Stephen Colbert</a> during their sit-down. “They had given him a short time to live if he didn’t get a lung transplant and thankfully he got one and he’s alive and thriving and well.”</p><p>“I took three years off to be with him and help him through that life journey,” she continued. When Stephen then praised Hilary for being a great daughter, she sweetly replied, “Well, what a lovely dad he is.” Back in 2015 the Oscar winner similarly spoke out about her dad’s ailing health and revealed it was “an honor” to step away from acting to care for her parent.</p><p>“There’s been job opportunities that I’ve passed on… But I mean, really, what we’re here for is our family, right? There’s been a couple projects that are beautiful, but in the end, there’s nothing I want to do more other than being with my dad in his time of need. You can’t get this time back,” Hilary <a href=#>said at the time</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hiilary-swank-oscar.jpg><p>Though Hilary has admitted she and her father were not close during her childhood, his lung transplant has actually brought them together today. “It’s actually kind of healing in a way,” she said. After her acting hiatus, Hilary is now returning to the small screen in the new FX series Trust. We’re thrilled to see Hilary back in Hollywood again and are so glad her dad is doing well!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkeqm1y5qpsmWjrK6vt4xqbG9tYW58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
