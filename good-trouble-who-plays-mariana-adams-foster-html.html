One of the biggest blows was losing the friends she made at Speckulate. They severed their relationship with her after they found out she was dating Evan Speck, the owner of the company they accused of fueling a hostile work environment for women and people of color.</p><p id=par-5_52>Mariana tried to salvage the relationship by breaking up with Evan and showing her support for her friends and their business venture, Bulk Beauty. Unfortunately, they couldn’t find it in their hearts to forgive her, so they walked out and said they couldn’t see themselves being her business partner or her friend.</p><h2 id=h-mariana-asks-her-friends-for-a-job>Mariana asks her friends for a job</h2><p id=par-6_70>With some prompting from Callie, Mariana decides to ask her former friends for a job as a programmer. It’s a demotion, but Callie points out that getting demoted and being able to get her friends back is better than not having their friendship at all. Mariana agrees and asks the group if they would take her back. They reluctantly accept her back and tell her she can work for them.</p><p id=par-7_45>It’s going to be tough for Mariana to adjust. She’s used to being in charge, so this will be a big change for her. Hopefully, things will work out and she will be able to work in a position where she isn’t calling the shots.</p><h2 id=h-what-s-next-for-cierra-ramirez>What’s next for Cierra Ramirez</h2><p id=par-8_40>Ramirez has a new project outside Good Trouble.
