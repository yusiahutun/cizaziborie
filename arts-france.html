Her son's former girlfriend, Anne-Catherine Kleinklaus, was also in court yesterday, charged with handling stolen goods.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Breitwieser, a former waiter who was extradited to France from Switzerland this year, is standing trial for a second time, in connection with the theft of 26 art objects which he stole in France, Austria and Denmark.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In his defence yesterday he insisted that he acted out of a passion for art rather than from an attempt to make a profit. "I've only stolen what interested me for my collection," he said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>"There was no desire for cupidity, no desire for lucre," his defence lawyer, Joseph Moser, said yesterday. "In this case, he never resold or sought to resell a work of art ... This was truly passion in its purest form."</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Of the 240 pictures and pieces of art he stole, only 112 have been recovered, with works by Watteau, Boucher and Dürer still missing. Many of those rescued were badly damaged during the theft and concealment - although Breitwieser insisted that he had tried to "restore" the works in his collection.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>"I think Mr Breitwieser will go into the record books, not only for the number of thefts he committed, but also for the destruction of art works," said Bernard Darties, head of France's central office for the prevention of art theft.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Breitwieser usually slipped the stolen items under his coat, waiting for the museum guards to be distracted. From his prison cell in Switzerland, he wrote to a number of the small museums which he had targeted, offering them advice on ways they could improve security.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK%2Bfp7mle5FpZ25nmpa7cHyWaJirrKNjs7OtzZyc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
