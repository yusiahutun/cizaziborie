I would also like there to be a teleporter that would allow me to go anywhere on Earth. How else would I get back to Earth to see my friends and family? Flying by rocket each time would be too wasteful.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Chris Chow, 16, STFA Seaward Woo College</span></strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>Which mythical creature do you wish you could ride to school?</span></strong></a></p><p><h2 type=h2><span type=text>Glass house</span></h2></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>My dream house would be shaped like a sphere and made of glass, and there would be a platform where you can bungee jump off.

Also, there would be a large workroom on the top floor where I could work or browse the web on my computer. Generally, I would be satisfied with my house as long as it is clutter-free and tidy. I just need a place where I can truly relax my stressed mind.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Fung Kwun-kit, 16, Carmel Secondary School</span></strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>From Stan Lee to Helen Keller: Which celebrity our readers would bring back to life</span></strong></a></p><p><h2 type=h2><span type=text>Home sweet home</span></h2></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>My dream house would be entirely made of candy.

It would be surrounded by a pool and would look very modern with large windows that allow natural light to shine through. The kitchen, dining room and living room would be on the first floor, and on the second floor there would be a gym room, karaoke room, music room and library. My bedroom would take up the whole top floor, with my bed and work desk facing the island’s best view.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Tiffany Yeung, 16, Maryknoll Convent School (Secondary Section)</span></strong></p><p><h2 type=h2><span type=span><span type=text>Five stories high</span></span></h2></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>My dream house would be in America.

I would also want there to be a farm and swimming pool in front of the house. The house would have five floors, and there would be a big slide on the fifth floor that could take you all the way to the bottom. The interior design would be classical but each room would have a different theme.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Wendy Leung Ka-man, 14, Henrietta Secondary School</span></strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>What would you put in your ultimate Lunar New Year sweet box?</span></strong></a></p><p><h2 type=h2><span type=text>Location, location, location</span></h2></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>My dream is to live in a large, independent house surrounded by a large garden filled with flowers and trees.

I’ve always loved the sound of birds chirping and water flowing.
