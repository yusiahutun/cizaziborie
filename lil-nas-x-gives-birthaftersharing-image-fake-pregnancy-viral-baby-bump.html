The music star put up several media posts likening his album release to the impending birth of a child. And yes it came complete with a well-rounded baby bump!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download-lil-nas-x.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lil_Nas_X_Speaks_On_His_Mysterious_Baby_Bump></span>Lil Nas X Speaks On His Mysterious Baby Bump<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Just before his debut project was released. Fans must have wondered why he <a href=#>had a baby bump, </a>why he chose to introduce his album that way and how he came about the idea.</p><p>Lik Nas X, who is known for pretty much defying the odds of conformity, opened up to People about his pregnancy idea. The rapper shared that Montero was literally his “baby.”</p><p>The star worked through last year’s pandemic lockdown, forging his creativity and putting his effort into making the album. He noted that it struck him that Montero was his baby after listening to Megan Thee Stallion’s verse on “Dollar Sign Slime.”</p><p>The young adult recalled calling his stylist and pitching his idea. He noted that his stylist was excited and they both came to the conclusion that “Montero’ was indeed his “baby.”</p><p>The “Old Town Road” crooner shared that after his stylist jokingly asked him to do a maternity shoot, he took it seriously. The next thing they knew, they were in a photography session, setting up props for a fake baby bump.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Feedback_From_Fans></span>The Feedback From Fans&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It is safe to say that Lil NasX is not new to social media feedback and scrutiny and his “Montero” introduction was no different. The hip-hop star took to his media pages where he <a href=#>posted images of his maternity shoot.</a></p><p>In one of the photos, the 22-year-old knelt close to a pool in an all-white outfit. He left his shirt unbuttoned to show his round belly, while his head was adorned with a white flower crown.</p><p>Lil Nas X held a bouquet in one hand while his other hand cradled his baby bump, reminiscent of expectant mothers. He duly <a href=#>wrote in his caption:</a></p><p>“SURPRISE! I can’t believe I’m finally announcing this. My little bundle of joy “MONTERO” is due September 17, 2021.”</p><p>Many of his fans were there for the creativity as they all fawned over him while showing support. His slew of admirers also showed their anticipation for the rapper’s first music compilation.</p><p>Lil Nas X also caught the attention of critics who showed disapproval and felt his style was inappropriate. The music star who is ever unbothered faced the critics head-on and seemed amused at most.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lil_Nas_X_Welcomes_%E2%80%9CMontero%E2%80%9D></span>Lil Nas X Welcomes “Montero.”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The “Panini” rapper organized a glamorous <a href=#>baby shower</a> and shared images of the event on social media. The 22-year-old was however disappointed about the absence of his invited guests.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Lil Nas X shared that his guest did not turn up for the event but stars like Megan Thee Stallion and <a href=#>Doja Cat</a> sent gifts. A few days after this, Lil Nas X shared another update on his bump.</p><p>This time it was a <a href=#>video</a> of him in the semblance of someone in labor. While he groaned, Lil Nas suggested that his album was on its way. On Thursday, September 17, 2021, Lil Nas X released his album.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuaq4jKeYrGWoYrSqwsSsZJuhoqm1orLTnqmsoJGntq%2BzjKKkmp%2BVYrOit8Rmp6udl6Our6%2FYZq2iqpGheqOtwbJkm62dpXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
