For that, I am forever grateful.”</p><p>Chris’s final Sportscenter was aired on March 31, 2016. It also included a special segment which included Chris McKendry long time career with the show.She will be grand slam host and will be hosting Australian Open each January along with US Open in late summer each year.</p><p>“Chris instantly and seamlessly became part of the traveling road show that is the ESPN tennis family,” said Jamie Reynolds, ESPN vice president, production.&nbsp; “Our telecasts are elevated by her professionalism, dedication, personality and a lifelong love of tennis, and we all look forward to continuing to have her as part of the team.”</p><p></p><h2>McKendry Signs with ESPN!</h2><p>Chris McKendry has reached an<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> agreement with ESPN</a> in which former SportsCenter anchor will have her sights on tennis and will continue to work for ESPN including&nbsp;coverage of three of the sport’s Majors tournaments – the Australian and US Opens and Wimbledon. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tennis snow</a>, Chris McKendry said:</p><p>"I am very excited for this change. From the time I was assigned the Australian Open in January of 2010, it hit me: This is the next step in my career. To be not just an anchor, but a host. To go to these big events, it's so exciting. I've told many people: It's one of those genies you can't put back in the bottle. Once you do a Grand Slam event, it's hard not to want to do it again. I just kept working at it with the hope that maybe I could make the transition to a full-time position.</p><p>I'm so excited; it's something I planned for and worked for. That being said, the day before my last SportsCenter that's when it me, going into the Bristol studios, how many great people I'm probably not going to see again or work with again. Never say never, but a lot of the analysts that I know so well in tennis—like 10 minutes before you called I was chatting with Mary Joe (Fernandez) catching up—we're friends, we're close friends. I have a lot of analyst friends like that I've met in every sport because of SportsCenter. So it was emotional. It was more emotional than I expected on the last day, but it's been 20 years of my life. Now that my final SportsCenter is said and done, I'm moving on and excited".</p><h2>Married Life, Husband, and Children?</h2><p>Chris McKendry is married. Yes, she is married to Eduardo Andrade.
