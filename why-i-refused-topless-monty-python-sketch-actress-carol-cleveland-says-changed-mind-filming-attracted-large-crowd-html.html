 Carol Cleveland, the 'Female Python', pictured here in 1971, was known for her scantily clad roles on Monty Python's Flying Circus
She never hesitated to make the most of her voluptuous figure in their sketches, but at times the Monty Python boys went too far even for Carol Cleveland."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s a little bit ruder than it has been in the past.’</span></p><p><span>Despite the similarities, there are some changes from the heyday on the 1970s, including Miss Cleveland’s role.</span></p><p><span>She said: ‘We have 20 ensemble boys and girls and 20 beautiful young ladies, I am now playing more character roles and they are paying my roles in the show. It will be emotional.’</span></p><p><span>She added: ‘Over the last two years I have finally started playing my age. And I am so happy that I am playing these roles. I feel this is a new chapter in my life.’</span></p><p><span>Fans are already excited for the 10-date run, which starts on July 1, with tickets selling out in only 43.5 seconds.</span></p><p><span>The three-hour show will contain both new material and see the group recreate some of their best-loved sketches, including The Parrot Sketch, the Argument Sketch and the song Christmas in Heaven from the film Monty Python and the Meaning of Life.</span></p><p><span>It promises to be very lucrative for the comedians, with Mr Jones joking after the announcement: ‘I’m quite excited about it. I hope it makes us a lot of money. I hope to be able to pay off my mortgage!’</span></p><p><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmlvbmBsfnJ7tqGwZoFdp7KnwdKem2asn6W5pr%2FSZoSopqSuepHF06Gmp2WjoLK1r8dmeJysoprAtHmimqmopF14uabCxKWYp5xdqK66v4ycn5qml5qxbrnIp5tmnpmhuqq6xmaYrayilrC1scNmo5qql5p6pL7OsJtnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
