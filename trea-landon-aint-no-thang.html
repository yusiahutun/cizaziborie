Landon wrote &#34;Ain't No Thang&#34; with Trent Willmon and Aaron Scherz. The feel-good country track blends electric guitars with an ultra-modern bed track, but the lyrics draw from the classic country influences that he grew up with."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Landon's latest, "Ain't No Thang," is set to drop Friday (Oct. 13), but his fans can hear it early via this Taste of Country exclusive.</p><p>Landon wrote "Ain't No Thang" with Trent Willmon and Aaron Scherz. The feel-good country track blends electric guitars with an ultra-modern bed track, but the lyrics draw from the classic country influences that he grew up with.</p><p>"It ain't no thang, that's just the way we do it when we do it 'round here / I wouldn't change being raised on hellfire, brimstone and ice cold beer / Country song on the radio twangin', barefoot girl on the front porch swingin' / If you don't get it we don't give a dang / Just livin' like we're livin' and it ain't no thang," he sings in the enormously catchy chorus.</p><p>Landon's path to success has been an unusual one. He began playing guitar at age 16, and he dabbled in metal before realizing that country music was his true musical destiny. The singer-songwriter moved from his native Georgia to Nashville in 2015, and within weeks he signed a publishing deal with Play It Again Publishing, which is owned by fellow Georgia boy <a href=#>Dallas Davidson</a>, one of Nashville's most influential songwriters and publishers.</p><p>Since then Landon's been writing with Davidson, <a href=#>Chris Young</a> and <a href=#>Craig Campbell</a>, and he released his self-titled debut EP on June 9. It wasn't long before "A Little Bit" was added to Spotify's New Boots playlist and Pandora's New Country playlist, and another song, "When I Get There," has been featured on SiriusXM The Highway's On the Horizon program. With the surprise release of "Ain't No Thang," Landon is giving thanks&nbsp;to those who have helped him get this far.</p><p>"I wanna give my fans the country music they've been asking for," he says, adding, "Here's to y'all!"</p><p><strong>Listen to Trea Landon, "Ain't No Thang"</strong></p><p><strong>See the Best Albums of 2017 (So Far)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmraqVlnqtrc2dpqdlkZ67tXnNqGStoJGjtHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
