Prentice said that she avoids the area because of the rats and that complaints she filed with the city were closed after officials told her they were “working on the problem”.

I don’t know what the city can do about this rat condominium. It’s really gross.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prentice said that she avoids the area because of the rats and that complaints she filed with the city were closed after officials told her they were “working on the problem”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It means you can’t lay down and relax in that park,” she said. “What kind of an answer is this?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such gripes have found an advocate in Comptroller Scott Stringer, the city's top financial officer, who has taken on the self-appointed role of rat czar. In separate audits over the past two years, he has criticised the city’s health department for not responding quickly enough to rat complaints, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subways, for not cleaning stations more regularly. Such breakdowns, he says, have allowed rats to thrive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve seen rats walking upright, saying, ‘Good morning, Mr. Comptroller,’” he said. “It’s unsightly to see rats running through neighbourhoods like they actually bought a co-op somewhere.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">New York officials who have been fighting the battle for decades say rising complaint numbers do not mean there are more rats, and they argue the rat population has actually been holding steady the past few years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2015/10/19/5fbbca06-760c-11e5-847c-d48162485282_486x.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Columbia University doctoral student using statistical analysis last year estimated the number of rats in the city at 2 million, claiming to debunk a popular theory that there is one rat for each of the city’s 8.4 million people. But scientists and city officials say it’s impossible to accurately estimate the number.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The spike in complaints of rat sightings and conditions attracting rodents is probably because garbage was left festering on sidewalks during last winter's large snowfalls, and registering complaints is easier now with the city's 311 complaint line smartphone app, said Caroline Bragdon, a city's health department scientist and resident rat expert.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bragdon's team responds to such complaints, compiles a citywide “rat index” and inspects dozens of buildings each month. What started as a team of less than a dozen has now expanded to nearly 50 people, working with a nearly US$3 million annual budget to implement the latest push to control rodents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mayor Bill de Blasio’s new “rat reservoir” plan targets communities with the highest number of rat complaints and seeks to dismantle habitats and food sources. That effort includes setting traps, installing rodent-resistant trash cans and working on legislation that would require restaurants to hose away sludge from dripping garbage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Every little bit helps, Bragdon said. Unlike the voracious Pizza Rat, she says, most rats need only an about an 28 grams of food and water daily to survive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s an apple core, it’s a piece of a hotdog, a couple of chips. It’s the crumbs,” she said. “You’d much rather prevent rats from being here than treat them with poison after they’re here.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">City health inspectors regularly scour the city, poking into sewer grates and crawling under park foliage, searching for the signs many would never notice: tiny mounds of dirt that lead to an underground rat burrow, streaks in walls about an inch off the ground left by greasy fur, or tiny holes the critters can crawl through.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Here’s a big burrow, and it's fresh,” Bragdon said during a recent inspection of a small park in Manhattan's Chinatown neighbourhood, notorious for its rat problem.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As she pointed to the hole, a furry little head popped out, revealing one of the newest generation of New York City rats.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bragdon greeted it: “Hi, mister.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyivtOimqWdX2aFd4WSbWloqpGperSx0a%2Bmoqpdo7K4edioqaRlk57Bur%2BMq6adnZ6peqS%2ByKygrGWimrGwwcGlnKxlkarBqbvRoquinaNisqeyzqurrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
