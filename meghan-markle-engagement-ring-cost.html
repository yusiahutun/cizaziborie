Harry flanked the center stone with two round diamonds from a brooch that belonged to his mother, Princess Diana. In speaking about the design of the ring, Harry noted that his decision to incorporate his mother's stones was similar to William's choice to give Catherine a ring of his mother's, as both hoped to have her along in spirit for their life's next chapter. Said Harry, "The little diamonds on either side are from my mother's jewelry collection to make sure that she's with us on this crazy journey together."</p><img alt="Suit, Photograph, White, Clothing, Formal wear, Tuxedo, Dress, Hairstyle, Fashion, Event, " title="Suit, Photograph, White, Clothing, Formal wear, Tuxedo, Dress, Hairstyle, Fashion, Event, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-prince-harry-meghan-markle-embed-gettyimages-880161528-1524995587.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But how much does a ring like Meghan's cost?

If size was of the utmost importance, a three-carat diamond of lesser quality in color and clarity (but of the same cushion cut) could retail for as low as $80,000. While clarity, color, carat weight and cut are key factors in determining the price of any stone, odds are Harry chose a flawless stone for his future bride, leaving the price of the stone he sourced on the highest end of this sliding scale.</p><img alt="Hand, Finger, Ring, Nail, Wedding ring, Wedding ceremony supply, Gesture, Interaction, Engagement ring, Holding hands, " title="Hand, Finger, Ring, Nail, Wedding ring, Wedding ceremony supply, Gesture, Interaction, Engagement ring, Holding hands, " width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-prince-harry-meghan-markle-embed-gettyimages-880224430-1524995808.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meghan's stone was set on a yellow gold band, and flanked with two round stones of Diana's; TIME tapped Kathryn Money, VP of strategy and merchandising at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.brilliantearth.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brilliant Earth" data-vars-ga-product-id=1eee4d47-3f7f-45c2-9fde-92b2c948cb93 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.brilliantearth.com/ data-product-url=https://www.brilliantearth.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brilliantearth.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=d76345c5-fe63-4d14-bf96-a0f8a1f08a44 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Brilliant Earth</a>, who estimated that the carat weight of the entire ring was likely 6.5 carats, with the center stone weighing in at around 5 carats on its own.

That ring reportedly cost 28,000 British pounds (or around $37,307, using modern conversion rates) when Prince Charles bought it back in 1981," but <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bustle.com/p/how-much-is-meghan-markles-engagement-ring-worth-the-custom-ring-features-dianas-priceless-diamonds-5555282 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to Bustle" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">according to Bustle</a>, the ring's worth has drastically risen in value over time, and now comes in at an approximate £300,000 ($500,000) price tag. (Note: Both Bustle and The Evening Standard report that the Duchess of Cambridge's stone weighs in at 12-carats, rather than 18 per TIME).</p><img alt="Suit, Formal wear, Smile, Photography, Sitting, White-collar worker, Photo shoot, Tuxedo, Outerwear, Event, " title="Suit, Formal wear, Smile, Photography, Sitting, White-collar worker, Photo shoot, Tuxedo, Outerwear, Event, " width=1030 height=1368 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2018-04-29-at-11-58-02-am-1524995933.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Alexi Lubomirski</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Bustle, who spoke with Grant Mobley, a gemologist and Director at Pluczenik, Markle's center stone is closer to 3-4 carats, with the side stones weighing in at around .75 carats each. With the understanding that the stones are flawless or close to, that math puts the ring closer to $200,000 in price, 2.5x less than the cost of the current market value of Catherine's ring. However, Mobley tells Bustle, "Diamonds not only maintain their value over time but they actually appreciate in value, unlike laboratory grown diamonds that have recently emerged in the diamond marketplace," Notes the site, "in other words, Markle's engagement ring could already be worth nearly as much as Middleton's rock, if not more." <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.standard.co.uk/fashion/news/meghan-markles-engagement-ring-how-big-is-it-how-much-does-it-cost-and-who-helped-harry-design-it-a3704101.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Evening Standard" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Evening Standard</a> echoes Bustle's size and price quote of Markle's stunning ring, marking its value at up to $200,000 per industry experts. While the royal family will never release the exact cost Prince Harry paid for the ring, any expert asked also agrees that this particular ring–market value, carat weight, cut, clarity and color aside–is priceless given its place in history and its use of diamonds that once belonged to Princess Diana.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/916d9b02-8867-4c91-934d-6abbc239c04d_1547134719.png alt="Headshot of Carrie Goldberg" title="Headshot of Carrie Goldberg" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Carrie Goldberg is HarpersBAZAAR.com’s Weddings & Travel Director.
