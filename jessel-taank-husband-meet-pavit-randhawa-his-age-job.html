Their romance, however, did not spark immediately and they remained close friends for years before they began to date.

That was when Jessel started paying closer attention and ended up asking him out to dinner.</p><p>They started dating of course and three years into the relationship, Pavit proposed to her. After having successfully tricked Jessel into thinking he was going to propose more than once, Pavit had finally popped the question on Labor Day weekend.</p><p>They were long distances for a significant period of time. Pavit was accepted into the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business and Jessel was working in New York with Michael Kors.

The Sikh ceremony, which took place at 10:00 a.m. in the hotel’s gazebo, was more traditional, and since her head needed to be covered, she had gone for a little more volume with her hair and a bold red lip to offset the red gown. During Hindu ceremony, which was held at sunset, called for a more subtle look.</p><p>As for why Jessel chose Riviera Maya as their wedding destination, she said, it was because it was home to Xcaret, an eco-archaeological park in the heart of the jungle that features an ancient Mayan cave.</p><p>As for the rest, their intention for the guests was to “drink, dance, and have a blast”.
