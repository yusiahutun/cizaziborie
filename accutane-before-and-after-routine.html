"This decrease reduces the amount of oil your skin produces, which effectively starves the acne-causing&nbsp;C. acnes bacteria that live in your pores. However, by doing so, Accutane also makes your skin much dryer and more sensitive, meaning that after a course of Accutane, it may be in need of some serious TLC."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, the impact may not last forever.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Accutane helps to reduce the number of&nbsp;C. acnes&nbsp;on skin, but they can creep back up over time," Dr. Marinelli added.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's why she also suggested developing an alternate skin care plan for the duration of the treatment along with taking the medication.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-use-accutane></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Use Accutane</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While on Accutane, your skin becomes extremely sensitive, limiting the types of products you can use within your skin care routine. In the morning, Dr. Marinelli suggested washing your face with a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gentle cleanser</a>&nbsp;that won't strip the skin, followed by a non-comedogenic moisturizer and sunscreen to nourish the skin and add a layer of UV protection. You may also incorporate a serum before your moisturizer, but be sure not to use any that contain high concentrations of AHAs/BHAs or vitamin C, as it may cause irritation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At night, you can repeat this same routine without the SPF," she added.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-expect></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Expect</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The thing about Accutane is that it typically purges your skin&nbsp;before&nbsp;it begins to work, essentially meaning that your acne is going to get worse before it gets better. In my case, my skin was constantly dry and required consistent hydration; the corners of my mouth and inside of my nose would crack and bleed, my joints would ache, and my head would hurt almost all the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first time I used the medication, my day and nighttime routines were very simple. I stuck with the basics:&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Daily Facial Moisturizer</a>, as recommended by my dermatologist. I was also advised to stay away from any heavy exfoliation or products that were not made for sensitive skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The rigorous requirements involved with taking Accutane definitely made my life quite difficult. Not only did I have to deal with having monthly blood work done and unexpected medical costs, but the physical and mental toll that Accutane took on me wreaked just as much havoc.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Imagine this: You have just started your first week at an internship with a well-known PR agency on their fashion and beauty team. You want to try to look your best every day and seemingly blend in with all the stylish women around you, but it literally hurts to put makeup on your face. Not to mention, you also are attending a fashion business school, where your whole look from head to toe is silently judged by your peers on a daily basis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are some days when you don't even want to go to class or your internship because you're breaking out so badly and are embarrassed to show your face. This was me during the fall of 2018, as I had&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aquaphor</a>&nbsp;glued to my hand along with a full bottle of water at all times to deal with the dryness caused by the meds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The mental and emotional component of being on this medication truly tests you in ways you might never have thought of otherwise. So, preparing yourself for these side effects is crucial if you and your doctor decide Accutane will be the acne treatment for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I was on it, I tried to indulge in my favorite activities. I made sure I took walks outside when the weather was nice, got my favorite snacks, and tried to relax as much as possible. I found that trying to distract myself by watching movies and reading up on other people's experiences helped me cope when I was having a particularly bad&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>mental health day</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-results></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Results</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After nearly six months of constant agony and annoyance in relation to my skin, there was finally a breakthrough. All of a sudden, my skin began clearing up, and my pimples all started to fade away. What I was left with was certainly not a blank canvas due to the scarring and discoloration caused by previous breakouts, but I was happy to see progress nonetheless.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the next eight months or so, my skin was in a place I had never imagined it would be: clear, glowing, and improving by the day. I began to have some professional skin treatments done (i.e. chemical peels) and was loving all the improvements I was seeing in my overall complexion. Then, I went off of Accutane.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aftercare></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aftercare</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Post-Accutane, your skin should be pretty low maintenance, but it may take some time to adjust. I developed an entirely new skin care routine and was trying out new products I could finally withstand now that I was off the medication. At the time, I was using the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tatcha Rice Polish Foaming Enzyme Cleanser</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Skinceuticals C E Ferulic Serum</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>First Aid Beauty Ultra-Repair Cream</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Tatcha powder cleanser offered light physical exfoliation that my skin could handle. The Skinceuticals serum was given to me by the esthetician I went to for the chemical peels, and it really helped with the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dark spots</a>&nbsp;that were left behind from my acne. As for First Aid Beauty's cream, it helped to keep my skin hydrated and soft.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, a few months later, my acne slowly began to creep back. After trying out several different remedies, I made the difficult decision to restart Accutane, something I had hoped I would never have to do. This time, though, I knew what was ahead of me. I was prepared to roll with the punches, ready for round two — and all the subsequent side effects — from incredibly dry skin and hair to headaches and mild joint pain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that I've passed the finish line, I'm incorporating products like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% Zinc 1%</a>&nbsp;into my routine. I'm also using&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream SPF 30</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>The Ordinary "Buffet" Serum</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel=nofollow>Ole Henriksen Banana Bright Eye Cream</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Salicylic Acid vs. Benzoyl Peroxide — Which One Should I Use to Treat My Acne?</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-final-thoughts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Final Thoughts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the side effects and discomfort, I found Accutane to be an excellent solution for my long-term acne.
