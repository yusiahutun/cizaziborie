It is the first time since 1998 that none of those teams have reached the knockout stage.\</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Coach Marc Wilmots made seven changes from the side that beat Russia against team who needed three points to have any chance of progressing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He transformed the defence in the absence of captain Vincent Kompany and Thomas Vermaelen, both of whom were injured, and gave a start to 19-year old Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is a World Cup played in a very hot country, so you have to anticipate,” Wilmots said. “I saved, I spared those I thought I had to spare. Now everybody is at the same level.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The changes almost backfired when one of the new boys, Steven Defour, was sent off for a foolish stamp shortly before half-time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Belgium recovered from the setback to show great resolve.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their towering defensive line remained strong with full back Jan Vertonghen outstanding.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">WATCH: Jan Vertonghen scores for Belgium</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was Vertonghen, allied with another substitute who won them the game. Teenager Divock Origi, making his third substitute appearance in three games, got free of the Korean midfield to fire in a shot that Jung Sung-ryong could only parry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vertonghen had charged forward and slotted the rebound home. It was a fitting reward for the man of the match.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wilmots had said his fringe players were itching for a chance to “showcase what they can do” and they did not disappoint.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their confidence is growing and they have an eminently winnable last-16 game against the United States coming up next.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Just do not bet on them turning on the style again.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What does it mean to play beautifully?” Wilmots asked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Every game is characterised by tactics and physical fitness. What is important in the end is the result, to win the match with whatever style of play. We are not here to look at them (other teams). We are here to win ... The rest is literature.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mrKeTmLKze8Crq6KbnJp8coGTamtpb1%2BovLbAx2aiqKqVlnpxecGeo6ChpaJ6cnmQaWSmmZ5iv6awjJ2cr6GcqHqurcqeZKKsXam1s7HEZq6ipqNiwam%2BxJ4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
