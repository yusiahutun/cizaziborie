She was born on July 31, 1964, in Holly Springs, Mississippi, USA.</p><p>It is known that Davis began attending Spelman College in Atlanta in 1984. She studied music but was unable to complete her doctorate because she was forbidden to perform religious music during her last lecture. Davis left college without the remaining credit she needed to graduate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cassi-Davis-1.jpg><p>However, she went back to Spelman in 2008 to graduate. When asked about the decision, she stressed the need for education.</p><p>“I may be part of a successful television program,” she said, “but I want to achieve much more. This degree will open up many more opportunities for me.</p><p>Finally, she earned recognition and graduated from Spelman College in 2009.</p><p>Cassi Davis’ acting career dates back to 1988 when she appeared in the Spike Lee film “School Daze”. While her<a href=# rel=noopener> early television credits</a> were identified as appearances on “The PJ”, “Kenan & Kel”, “Living Single” and others, it is believed that the tender stage of her career was her stage work with Kim Fields-Morgan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cassi-Davis-Age.jpg><p>It was in one of her works with Kim Fields-Morgan that Tyler Perry aroused interest in her. Cassi Davis then established herself with her many appearances in Perry’s productions.</p><p>In 2004, Cassi won the NAACP Los Angeles Chapter’s Best Supporting Actress award. In 2010 and 2013 she won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series – House of Payne (2006).</p><p>Davis will say, “It’s all about Jesus,” when you ask her how she built her acting career. She described herself as a “born-again Christian” and attributed her success to her faith.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cassi-Davis-2-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Cassi Davis Education</strong></h2><p>In 1988, actress Kym E. Davis was cast in the role of Paula for Spike Lee’s musical comedy-drama film School Daze. Drawing from his own experiences as a student at Morehouse College in the Atlanta University Center during the 1970s, Lee crafted a story that delved into many issues affecting African American communities such as classism, hair texture bias, social mobility, colorism, and political activism to name just a few. This movie served to highlight these important topics through an entertaining medium and has since become an iconic classic of its genre.</p><p>After leaving Spelman College one credit short of her degree due to not being allowed to perform religious music during her senior recital, Davis made it back and earned her major in Music from the college in 2008. Despite the initial setback, she was able to overcome this obstacle and complete her studies at Spelman College located in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Tyler Perry Son, Wife, Net Worth, House, Gay, Baby, Married, Height, Bio</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Married/ Husband/ Children</strong></h2><p>The questions Cassi Davis’ fans are most likely to ask to relate to their private lives. “Who is Cassi Davis’ husband”, “Is Cassi Davis married” and “Who are Cassi Davis’ children” are frequent questions to the American actress.</p><p>It has been speculated several times that Cassi Davis is married to Lavan Davis – an American actor who is also known for his role as Curtis Payne in “Tyler Perry’s House of Payne”.</p><p>Like Cassi, Lavan played many roles in Perry’s productions. Cassi and Lavan were portrayed as partners in some productions. While Cassie (Ella Payne) was married to Lavan (Curtis Payne) in the “House of Payne”, they acted as a couple in the play “Madea Goes to Jail” and were also together in the movie “Daddy’s Little Girls”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cassi-Davis-2.jpg><p>Probably that’s why it’s often assumed that Cassi Davis is married to Lavan Davis in real life. As far as I know, she’s not married to Lavan or anyone else. She is still single.</p><p>LaVan and Cassi were invited to a TV show sometime in 2011 – “You and me this morning”. It was hoped that the show would give many answers to Cassi’s private life and explicitly show her marital status.</p><p>That did it pretty well. But many were even more confused in the end. In the TV show, Cassi and Lavan were asked to comment on the belief that they were married. In response, they denied it and admitted that they were married.</p><p>While Cassi denies that she is married to Lavan, Lavan remarks that he is married to Cassi. Below you can watch the conversation between Cassi and Lavan on the TV show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What happened to Cassi Davis?</strong></h2><p>The actress does not have a stroke but rather is suffering from Bell’s Palsy which causes her face to droop on one side. This has led some to mistakenly believe that she had a stroke however this is not the case.</p><p>Since her diagnosis of the disease in March 2020 her husband has been a great source of support throughout her therapy journey. He has shown unwavering commitment to helping and encouraging his wife during this difficult time.</p><p>Despite her visible gait the actress has yet to disclose what is causing her limp.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=2><tr><td><strong>Full Name:</strong></td><td>Cassandra Davis-Patton</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nick Name:</strong></td><td>Cassi Davis</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date Of Birth</strong></td><td>31 July 1964</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>59 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gender:</strong></td><td>Female</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Birthplace</strong></td><td>Holly Springs, Mississippi, United States of America</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Actress, singer</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sexuality:</strong></td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>5 feet 5 inch (1.65 m)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>85 kg (187 lbs.)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status:</strong></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spouse:</strong></td><td>Kerry Patton</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alma mater:</strong></td><td>Spelman College</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$6 million</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksKK%2F0qJknZmmnsBurcaeZKGto5eur7CMnJ%2BipJSnsq95waKmZqWRp7%2BqscNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
