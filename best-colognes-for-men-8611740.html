At some point, perhaps without even realizing it, you purchase your last bottle of Axe Body Spray (or, if you’re like me, Abercrombie & Fitch’s Fierce, the unofficial scent of seemingly all shopping malls in the early 2000s that had men of a certain age in a chokehold for years) in favor of something a bit more elevated. Because scent is so subjective, embarking on finding the best cologne for you can be intimidating. What smells great on me might repulse you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And not for nothing, many cost a pretty penny, and no one wants to make an investment in something they won’t use. “Finding a truly spectacular cologne is all in the composition,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Marcella Bijou</a>, senior product developer for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">SOS Beauty</a>, who adds that it all starts with “balancing the right materials to create a harmonious, wearable, and timeless scent.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fortunately, we’re here to assist: We spoke to four fragrance experts to help us cut through the noise to curate a list of the most popular, classic, and modern colognes for men. Several <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle editors</a> — and self-described fragrance snobs — tested each cologne on their skin, hair, and across various fabrics, to evaluate the scent composition and whether the fragrance notes were expertly balanced, along with the cologne’s staying power on different surfaces, and even how the cologne bottle impacted our experience — but most importantly, its overall alluring appeal. Out of 27 fragrances, you’ll find our very favorite colognes for men on the list below.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-acqua-di-parma-colonia></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Acqua di Parma Colonia</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Acqua di Parma Colonia " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rqom7gZnaBGcAzfGhh69Lc2VlpQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/acqua-di-parma-colonia-c9e26bef5ef64ae8a9531beaaf9059df.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Acqua di Parma</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This refreshing cologne isn’t “too” anything, so it's a versatile scent that vibes in any scenario.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The scent on the skin was very light by the end of the day, so you may need to reapply.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Developed more than 100 years ago, it took just one spray for us to discover what gives this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>classic fragrance</a> its staying power…no pun intended. With a balanced blend of bright fruity top notes and warm base notes of vetiver, sandalwood and patchouli, we particularly loved this fragrance for its versatility: A perfect choice for day or night, for all seasons and for any gender. The first spray comes on strong with a delectable blend of sweet and musky notes, which softens after about 30 minutes for an overall refreshing and sophisticated scent that lingers all day.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Art Deco-inspired bottle is the classic Acqua di Parma design that feels timeless: Simple and elegant, it definitely doesn’t look or feel cheap, but isn’t trying too hard to beclass luxurious. The twist off cap is a delightful nod to the past, as modern fragrance bottles seem to opt for magnetic caps. Depending on your personal preferences, just one spray will have you smelling light and fresh, while two to three sprays will give you a stronger (but not heavy) scent that retains its refreshing effect, especially when the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fragrance is sprayed into hair</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de cologne｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Lemon, sweet orange, Calabrian bergamot, lavender, vetiver, sandalwood｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Citrus｜<strong>Size</strong>: 3.4 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-cremo-spice--black-vanilla-eau-de-toilette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cremo Spice & Black Vanilla</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Cremo Spice and Black Vanilla" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pld6BU1Pcq3fVxRJXf0yDhopj00=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/61oCN-VF7IL._SL1500_-4dfa375abc504abcab5fb45a0cd53b92.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>From the quality of this spice vanilla cologne to its packaging, it feels much more expensive than it is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The fragrance is distinct and spicy, so might be your favorite if you prefer something more low key.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s easy to experience sticker shock while cologne shopping, with the price tags of high end scents coming in well above $250 per bottle. Mercifully, that's not the case here: This eau de toilette is a warm, slightly sweet yet spicy fragrance that has a surprising staying power on skin, fabric and in hair. For such an approachable price point, they didn’t skimp on the packaging, which is reminiscent of much more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>expensive perfume brands</a>. The rectangular glass bottle is simple, sophisticated, with as expensive-feeling weight that also makes it easy to hold. Plus, you can’t beat the convenience of being able to purchase from Amazon Prime!&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At first spray, we were met with the vibrant cardamom spice alongside a very short-lived alcohol smell. The cardamom and tobacco notes remained prevalent as it dried down, with a subtle sweet vanilla note revealing itself later. The warmth of this scent profile makes it ideal for the cooler temperatures of fall and winter, but would be great to pull out for dinner on a summer evening with an unusually cool breeze.&nbsp;Because this fragrance isn’t overpowering, we found ourselves reaching for this scent for everyday wear and to run errands. The mix of spices and vanilla is notably distinct, so this fragrance may not be for those who prefer a softer, more subtle scent.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de toilette｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Cardamom, cashmere wood, bourbon vanilla, vetiver｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Spicy, warm｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cologne-for-young-men-paco-rabanne-1-million-eau-de-toilette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cologne for Young Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Paco Rabanne 1 Million Eau de Toilette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Paco Rabanne 1 Million Eau de Toilette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/o45cjWDUeOnVW0ARkqnmUrbCdIo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/paco-rabanne-1-million-eau-de-toilette-cfff1a6d08074e709d847f602029f8e9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Paco Rabanne</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Musky and leathery, this cologne is great for the younger man with after work plans.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The spray mechanism isn’t the easiest to use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With its ostentatious packaging reminiscent of a gold brick and sophisticated masculine scent, young men won’t have to spend a fortune to smell like a million bucks. Formerly known as Paco Rabanne, the pseudonym for fashion designer Francisco Rabaneda Cuervo whose work and colognes date back to the 1960s, Rabanne 1 Million Eau de Toilette remains prevalent and popular since its launch in 2008. 1 Million is believed to be the last cologne that Rabanne himself had a hand in crafting.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This cologne’s heavy leather, woody, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rich amber notes</a> settled to reveal a touch of rose and citrus, yet is still solidly masculine. It smells like a modern take on a classic, but not in a way that will have you smelling like your dad. Three sprays will likely make you think you accidentally overdid it, but trust us; it'll settle down to a noticeably present-yet comfortable-scent level that has great staying power. It's encased within the brand's iconic gold brick bottle, evoking an old-school vibe, but the spray mechanism gets sticky, sometimes requiring a few pumps to elicit a full, even mist.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de toilette｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Frosted grapefruit, rose absolute, musk, amber ketal, blond leather, white wood｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Earthy, woody｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-summer-cologne-for-men-issey-miyake-leau-dissey-pour-homme></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Summer Cologne for Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Issey Miyake L'Eau d'Issey Pour Homme</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Issey Miyake L'Eau d'Issey Pour Homme" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0CptTKeXl1SEqYnE_KDqA153zPM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/issey-miyake-leau-dissey-pour-homme-fa4ee28434124168865f2a6d12ef4a18.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Issey Miyake</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>With bright citrus dancing atop delicate floral notes grounded in amber, this cologne is like summer in a bottle.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It smells very different on different fabrics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fresh, bright and light: just one spritz of this scent instantly transported us to summer vacation. Three sprays from elegantly understated on the wrist will give you all day staying power from lounging by the pool during the day to dinner al fresco. This cologne isn’t overwhelming, so you won’t be setting off anyone with fragrance sensitivities.&nbsp;This is a citrusy cologne that settles to reveal <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>floral notes</a>, which feel fresh and bright. The scent doesn’t feel too masculine or too feminine, so it makes for a great unisex choice, as well. Even the packaging feels clean, light and airy with cloudy glass and minimalistic design.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's a perfect choice for all kinds of summer activities, but be forewarned that it smells slightly different (and not always in a good way) across various fabrics — satin skewed sour while wool highlighted and intensified the floral notes, but on cotton and linen, it remained true to scent. Since these two are our fabrics of choice in the summer anyway, this doesn't bother us one bit.</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de toilette｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Yuzu, Mandarin orange, nutmeg, cinnamon, sandalwood, amber｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Citrus｜<strong>Size</strong>: 40 mL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fall-cologne-for-men-maison-margiela-replica-jazz-club-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fall Cologne for Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maison Margiela 'Replica' Jazz Club</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Maison Margiela 'Replica' Jazz Club Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mMRFuXp83kwnFqyNmK4Qd4KhmJA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/maison-margiela-replica-jazz-club-02749f601b5c4a4da37c85f568f07fa9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Out of all the colognes we tested, this one lives up to the vibe of its name the best.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The cologne left a slight stain on the satin we sprayed it on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Appropriately named, this cologne smells exactly like ordering a Black Manhattan Cocktail at a downtown jazz club on a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brisk fall evening</a>. The sophistication of this unisex scent is quiet luxury for fragrance lovers: It is well-balanced, has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>long staying power</a> on the skin without being overpowering and evokes confidence of the wearer, who no doubt paired the scent with a perfectly coordinated layered ensemble. To put it simply, this fragrance smells like you have good taste.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sophisticated, cozy, and smooth: this scents greets you with sweet rum and spicy pepper, grounded with smoky tobacco leaf and warm vanilla. The sweetness of the scent dissipates over time, allowing the tobacco and vanilla to shine through. While the design of this bottle is perfectly matched for the fragrance itself and its overall vibe, the lack of a cap means this fragrance can’t easily travel. The addition of a cap or an offering of a travel size would make this cologne a perfect addition to your bag in the colder months, especially for a refresh before a date or an evening event.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de toilette｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Pink pepper, rum absolute, tobacco leaf absolute｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Warm, spicy｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-winter-cologne-for-men-azzaro-the-most-wanted-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Winter Cologne for Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Azzaro The Most Wanted Eau de Parfum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Azzaro The Most Wanted Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jtyE1ekMOFuLj6iu9vWsPfRyxPY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/azzaro-the-most-wanted-eau-de-parfum-0ef494a3e4a046f19f98a9269f730db0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Azzaro</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Spicy and woodsy, it pairs well with a fire and good book.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The spray nozzle doesn’t work as well as it could.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Curling up by a fireplace in a knit sweater as it gently snows outside calls for a fragrance with spicy intensity. Bold and fiery, this fragrance evokes a sense of warmth to balance against the cold temperatures of winter. Factor in the bottle’s unapologetically masculine design, cementing Azzuro as an instantly recognizable collection, and pair the zippy scent with your favorite bourbon cocktail.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it’s important to note the intensity of this fragrance, it is not overpowering or headache-inducing; one spritz into the air and walking into it is enough to give you an all day scent. Fueled by a hit of ginger, we loved the woodsy blend balanced with subtle bourbon vanilla. The scent was consistent and had excellent staying power on almost everything we tested. The scent didn’t seem to blend well with denim, giving off a dirty smell (but, we don’t generally apply fragrance to our jeans).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de parfum｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Red ginger, incandescent woods accord, bourbon vanilla｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Spicy fougere｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-vanilla-cologne-tom-ford-tobacco-vanille></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Vanilla Cologne</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rRevrUqZVw6FIjAWK9VJLWHl0gA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Tom-Ford-Tobacco-Vanille-d62cb1a815c74138a62596d2edf2731c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The balance of tobacco makes the vanilla of this scent more approachable than a typical vanilla-forward cologne.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>While it smells great, the scent can be powerful, so apply cautiously.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While Tom Ford’s name is synonymous with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>luxury fragrance</a> — not to mention a Tom Ford fragrance bottle on your vanity is a status symbol on par with carrying a Chanel bag–Tobacco Vanille is arguably one of the most popular and recognizable from the lineup. The genius of this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>vanilla fragrance</a> is the sweet spice itself: or rather, the constraint of the vanilla’s presence. You can definitely detect vanilla, but it feels comfortable and approachable as it complements the bolder notes of smokey tobacco and spicy ginger.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the hallmarks of Tom Ford fragrances is their intensity: so be sure to apply with caution. We found that applying the fragrance to just the wrists provided all day staying power without overwhelming the senses. We noticed there was a slight oily texture on the skin, but it wasn’t irritating and dissipated quickly.&nbsp;While this is a very well-balanced scent, we wouldn’t mind even more tobacco to bring out more of the scent’s musk and wood.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de parfum｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Tobacco leaf, vanilla, ginger｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Warm, spicy｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-lasting-cologne-for-men-creed-aventus-for-men></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long-Lasting Cologne for Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Creed Aventus</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neiman Marcus Creed Aventus for Men" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7ZWwHObLc1nXBGDIv87p8-kSbo0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/creed-aventus-for-men-7c300a9151864b2fb35495d59b253fb7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>An undeniable classic cologne with above average staying power.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The price point is not for the cologne shopper on a budget.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to the brand, Aventus is the best selling men’s fragrance in the history of The House of Creed. Not too shabby for a fragrance house with a 250 year track record, including developing fragrances for royal houses. Aventus is fruit-forward, balanced with green, mossy undertones. Beyond smelling great, Aventus really impressed us for its staying power; the scent settles nicely on the skin and lasts all day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the fragrance seemed to vary slight fabric to fabric–it smelled more woodsy on linen and wool, more citrusy on satin and polyester–the scent remained impressively present no matter where we applied.&nbsp;Creed fragrances are also noted for their higher price point (entry pricing for Aventus starts at $265). Admittedly, at that cost, we’d expect a more luxuriously designed package overall, but we cannot deny that this isn’t a very high quality fragrance.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de parfum｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Apple, blackcurrant, pink pepper, jasmine, pineapple, oakmoss, cedarwood｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Woodsy, fruity｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-luxury-cologne-for-men-dior-sauvage-elixir></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Luxury Cologne for Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dior Sauvage Elixir</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dior Sauvage Elixir" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8_4xMk0eZ1Ry9BeXSafEBd26zG8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dior-sauvage-elixir-fd6d710bd90145b398ddf74cc2be7d9c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Wearing this cologne makes you feel more expensive.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The dose from one spray can be a bit too much.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A reinterpretation of Dior’s iconic Sauvage fragrance, Elixir is a spicier and longer-lasting iteration of the favored classic. This scent is fascinating: you’re initially met with florals, spice and a pinch of citrus. As it settles, notes of lavender, pepper and grapefruit pop through alongside patchouli and woodsy notes. We’re adding this into our rotation for the next hot date or important meeting where we need to make a lasting impression! Just like how a perfect accessory can change an entire outfit, this cologne can elevate your whole aesthetic.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From the Instagram-worthy bottle to the velvety sensory experience as this complex scent opens up, this is a sensual experience from start to finish. We’d recommend grabbing this fragrance in the late afternoon at the earliest, as this is the kind of scent you want to carry you into the early hours of the sun rising the next day. If we really had to nit-pick–which was hard with this one — we wish the sprayer dosed out a little bit less, as one spray is a lot!&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de parfum｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Grapefruit, lavender, amber｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Fresh, woodsy｜<strong>Size</strong>: 2 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-spicy-cologne-for-men-yves-saint-laurent-la-nuit-de-lhomme></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Spicy Cologne for Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit de l’Homme</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit de l&amp;acirc;Homme" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/v4qo48qK-R0F1S7h5C3n_C0q9ws=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/yves-saint-laurent-la-nuit-de-lhomme-f31056a1311f4c71880bc222846425b0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Yves Saint Laurent</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This cologne is the perfect blend of spicy and sexy.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The bottle is a bit clunky and heavy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For fans of Yves Saint Laurent’s beloved L’Homme Eau de Toilette, think of La Nuit as the bad boy older brother: sneaks out at night, wears a leather jacket, but is still irresistibly charming. For a spicy fragrance, we loved that this cologne doesn’t immediately hit you with too much spice, thanks to the fresh notes of bergamot and lavender. As it dries down, snappy cardamom shines without being too aggressive and stays with you all evening (this is one you are going to want to wear in the evening!).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike many spicy fragrances that feel intimidating, this one evokes a more approachable, cool-guy vibe instead of the too cool try hard. Woody cedar and earthy lavender balance out the zippy notes, culminating in a cologne that is spicy, smooth, and definitely present, but not attention-seeking.&nbsp;With its sensual packaging featuring a black gradient, black lettering and a black top, this bottle perfectly encapsulates the essence of the night. A fair warning: this bottle is substantial and quite heavy, so just make sure you pick it up from the base (and not the cap like we did) so you don’t drop it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de toilette｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Bergamot, cedar, lavender, vetiver｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Warm, spicy｜<strong>Size</strong>: 2 oz</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-37 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit de lâHomme sprayed onto a green cloth" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fOuIIcQ6hhF6BoLFA32VQKY_SdM=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-colognes-men-test-yves-saint-laurent-la-nuit-de-lhomme-jthompson-5256-537cc06921ea41e8af694408c6a00ebb.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit de lâHomme sprayed in a dark background" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kwH-uCXW1TwpkL6qpFC7rDvidK8=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-detail-yves-saint-laurent-la-nuit-de-lhomme-jthompson-0409-0035fcc0c18c4dc9be3f60c92241018a.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fresh-cologne-for-men-jo-malone-london-earl-grey--cucumber-cologne></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fresh Cologne for Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jo Malone London Earl Grey & Cucumber Cologne</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jo Malone London Earl Grey &amp;amp; Cucumber Cologne" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FsOeUdtgF82zXvk2NsEmvX1nbn4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jo-malone-london-earl-grey--cucumber-cologne-d308df32b8694ea7986bf079b6d7aaf2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This cologne is fresh, cool and unique-the kind of scent that will have strangers stopping you on the street to tell you how great you smell.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This scent doesn’t show up as well on some fabrics, so we recommend wearing it on your skin.<strong></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s an undeniable cool factor about the British fragrance house Jo Malone London.

Supported by a light beeswax that isn’t too sweet, there’s almost a smokiness to it that tempers the honey and feels masculine. Despite all of the notes inspired by items you’d find on a table, you’ll find yourself feeling calm and cool, not hungry.&nbsp;Overall, we found this cologne has excellent staying power and remains consistent throughout the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Cologne｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Bergamot, cucumber, vanilla, musk｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Warm, spicy｜<strong>Size</strong>: 100 mL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-woody-cologne-for-men-dior-homme-eau-de-toilette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Woody Cologne for Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>DIOR Homme Eau de Toilette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="DIOR Homme Eau de Toilette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-Fik0knq65hv2ScyqDR9AQJ-AOg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dior-homme-eau-de-toilette-52e18add1a6c4bfdbd327a7c9cc5e71e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dior</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>While this woody cologne is masculine and elevated, it’s extremely wearable and would appeal to a wide range of men.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The sophistication of this scent makes it less ideal for a younger man.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The hero of DIOR Homme Eau de Toilette is its Atlas cedar, apparently hand-chiseled in house, which only adds to the undeniably masculine and sensual appeal of this cologne. Buoyed by notes of patchouli and vetiver, the resulting scent experience is luxe and sophisticated, while still approachable and wearable. Once you get familiar with this scent, you’ll definitely clock it on evenings out as it’s widely appealing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found the fragrance to be long-lasting and holds up well on the skin, hair and fabrics after it dries down. With two to three sprays, the scent remains omnipresent without becoming overpowering. Make no mistake, however: this is not a casual fragrance. While it may not be a perfect fit for a younger man or everyday wear, you’ll want to reach for this one before a formal evening occasion, or if you work in a highly professional environment.&nbsp;While the bottle’s thick glass and sharper corners give a luxurious look and feel to the packaging, it would be a bit too heavy to carry with you in a gym bag or in a dopp kit when you’re traveling.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de toilette｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Cedar, patchouli, vetiver｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Woody｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-citrus-cologne-for-men-chanel-bleu-de-chanel-eau-de-toilette-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Citrus Cologne for Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chanel Bleu de Chanel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chanel Bleu de Chanel Eau de Toilette Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OqIPQwD7H-t4fJB88FPniqhq7wQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chanel-bleu-de-chanel-4f055edef8dd45978e52189a3ba4e0dd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This scent is bright and understated, making it easy to wear, especially for guys who are looking for their first cologne.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>While it smells great on a variety of fabrics, we did notice some staining on satin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since its 2010 debut, Bleu Chanel has catapulted to one of the most popular men’s fragrances in the world, with good reason. Bleu de Chanel is one of those fragrances that if you smell, you’ll think “he smells great,” making it an ideal pick for anyone who is looking for their first cologne. While this is undeniably an woodsy cologne rooted in notes of cedar and sandalwood, it’s the zesty grapefruit that balances the earthiness and brightens the overall scent to make for a wearable instant classic.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As is to be expected with a Chanel fragrance, this cologne was long-lasting and smelled great consistently across all the fabrics we tested on. Of note, the cologne did leave a stain on the satin we tested it on, but performed well everywhere else.&nbsp;Like it's brand ambassador Timothée Chalamet, Bleu de Chanel’s bottle is instantly recognizable. Marked by dark blue glass and minimalistic branding, this luxe bottle feels both classic and modern. We wish that it was a touch easier to spray, as it’s a very wide bottle (not ideal for those with smaller hands!) and when sprayed at a downward angle, the atomizer releases a lot of fluid instead of its usual fine mist.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de toilette｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Citrus accord, labdanum, sandalwood cedar｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Earthy, woody｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-classic-cologne-for-men-giorgio-armani-acqua-di-gio-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Classic Cologne for Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio Eau De Parfum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio Eau De Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wr1m8-rd4eNA77W2ERwueDhO3H4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/giorgio-armani-acqua-di-gio-eau-de-parfum-45a3058b4eec402582d8b5882edb88b1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Giorgio Armani</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This cologne is simply easy: if you’re looking for a traditional kind of scent that feels almost nostalgic, this is for you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The pump has a tendency to stick, which can make dosing your sprays a challenge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A department store staple for decades, Giorgio Armani’s Acqua di Giò family of colognes is instantly recognizable. The Eau de Parfum from the Acqua di Giò tribe is perfect for those looking for a more intense, longer lasting version of the iconic scent. We feel like this is exactly what cologne should smell like; the well-balanced blend of marine, green mandarin and sage feel both fresh and traditional, while remaining decidedly masculine.

On skin, the intensity fades quite a bit while maintaining a strong presence that doesn’t feel overpowering. No matter where we sprayed, the scent remained vibrant and long-lasting. It feels like the kind of scent you can rely on as you dance the night hours away.&nbsp;To boot, the bottle design, as is to be expected with Versace, is a showstopper in a bold blue featuring the brand's signature pattern engraved throughout the glass with a gold Medusa logo on the bottle and cap.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de parfum｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Mint leaves, orange blossom, vanilla Madagascar｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Warm, spicy｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html" readability=14.263265306122><li readability=11.368421052632><strong>Your Body Chemistry: </strong>All of our experts stressed the importance of testing cologne on your skin before purchasing, as colognes can smell vastly different from person to person. A variety of factors, like your individual pheromones, the natural oils on your skin, your body temperature, even the pH of your skin will impact how the cologne smells on you. “What smells sweet on me might pull spicier on you,” notes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Tynan Sinks</a>, fragrance expert and co-host of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Smell Ya Later</a> fragrance podcast.&nbsp;<p>Even though the same cologne will smell different on everyone, our body chemistry is not actually changing the fragrance itself, clarified Ranger Station founder Steve Soderholm: “The fragrance is mixing with our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>natural pheromones</a>.”</p><p>So what can you do if you love how a cologne smells on someone else, but don’t love how it smells on you? Unfortunately, you may be out of luck, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="nofollow nocaes">Dsm-Firmenich</a> master perfumer Alexandra Monet. “There is nothing you can do, you have to accept it and choose the fragrances that suit the best with your skin.”&nbsp;</p></li><li readability=1><strong>Staying Power: </strong>The label of your cologne can actually help you determine how long it will last on your skin. Colognes are categorized by the concentration of fragrance oil, as well as the amounts of alcohol and water, used in the formula. Fragrances with higher concentrations of oil will last longer on skin, while fragrances with lower concentrations will dissipate faster, according to Bijou.&nbsp;<p>While there isn’t a precise industry standard for these categories, most fragrances follow the concentration levels below:</p></li><li class=ql-indent-1><strong>Parfum</strong>: The highest concentration of fragrance oil, around 20-30%, which will last approximately 8 hours.</li><li class=ql-indent-1><strong>Eau de Parfum</strong>: A concentration of 15-20% fragrance oil, which will last around 4-6 hours.</li><li class=ql-indent-1><strong>Eau de Toilette</strong>: A concentration of 5-15% fragrance oil, which will last around 2-3 hours.&nbsp;</li><li class=ql-indent-1><strong>Eau de Cologne</strong>: A concentration of 2-4% fragrance oil, which will last around 2 hours.&nbsp;</li><li class=ql-indent-1><strong>Eau Fraîche</strong>: The lowest concentration of fragrance oil (most commonly found in body mists), approximately 1-3% of fragrance oil, which will last around 1-2 hours.|</li><li readability=13><strong>High Quality Ingredients: </strong>Navigating the ingredients and quality of colognes can be one of the most challenging aspects of shopping for a new scent. “‘Quality’ is subjective, because how do we define quality? Is it the high price of the raw materials, or how long they last on your skin?” questions Sinks. Bijou agrees, noting that “high quality” doesn’t necessarily mean a cologne has the most expensive raw ingredients, or the most natural ingredients. Rather, it’s the full picture experience — the harmony of the notes, the way the fragrance lingers on your skin and clothing, and most importantly, how it makes you feel while you wear it.<p>However, cost isn’t necessarily indicative of quality. For one, the concentration of the fragrance oil can have an impact here. “Body sprays are commonly more affordable products than eau de toilette or eau de parfum because of their concentration level,” says Monet.&nbsp;The cologne’s overall experience factors in here, as well. Some brands opt for more expensive packaging and flashy marketing, which can impact the cost of your cologne.</p><p>At the end of the day, selecting the perfect cologne is highly personal, notes Bijou: “Experience with fragrance is highly subjective, so it all comes down to preferences and compatibility!”</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Where are the best places to spray cologne?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Colognes perform best when applied to the skin, particularly to areas of the body with high blood circulation, also known as pulse points. On men, these points are the neck, armpits, knees, wrists, and behind the ears. The cologne will have the strongest effect in these areas, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Penny Coy</a>, Vice President of Merchandising for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ulta Beauty</a>, notes that the scent will best infuse with your body chemistry in these spots.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A pro tip from Sinks: spray the cologne in the crease of your arm, where your bicep meets for your forearm. “It's a major pulse point,” without the risk of accidentally rinsing your cologne off when you wash your hands.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you apply cologne so it stays?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to maximize the staying power of your cologne, our experts shared that cologne clings best to moisturized skin. “Always make sure your skin is moisturized with an unscented body lotion or oil first so the cologne can stick better,” advises Coy.</p><p>Cologne should also be applied directly to the skin, where it lasts the longest. “The most important thing to remember when applying cologne is to not rub it in,” recommends Bijou. “This is the most common mistake in fragrance application, but the process of rubbing into skin can cause the top notes to evaporate faster, which will impact the overall wear time. Instead, simply spray it and let it set.” <strong><br></strong></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I know if I'm wearing too much cologne?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you may be excited about your new great smelling cologne, there can definitely be too much of a good thing. “There is a moment when you get used to a fragrance, unfortunately, you start to smell it less and less on yourself,” warns Monet. In reality, the fragrance isn’t losing its power, you’ve just gotten too used to it. Bijou agrees, adding that “if the scent lingers too long or if you can constantly smell it on yourself or in the room, that’s a clear indication that you’ve overdone it.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Their advice? Avoid the temptation to keep spraying. “One small spray per area is the appropriate dosage,” advises Bijou. Building a fragrance wardrobe of different options can also help when you feel your cologne isn’t as powerful as it once was. Monet’s trick here is genius: “when you start to smell one [cologne] less on yourself, switch to another one for a little period of time, and come back to the first one, you’ll be able to smell it like the first time.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tyler Williams</a> is a beauty and communications professional with more than 15 years of experience in the industry.
