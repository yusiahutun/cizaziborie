Modern board games include features you don't ordinarily find in the classics, such as more intricate storylines, unique components (like <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">meeples</a>&nbsp;instead of pawns), and building the board as you play.</p><p>Board games vary when it comes to rules, style of play, and difficulty. Here are a few things to look into before you purchase a game:</p><ul><li><strong>Style of play:</strong> Board games generally come in one of three flavors: competitive, cooperative, or semi-cooperative. Competitive means everyone is for themselves, and the game ends with one winner. In a cooperative game, everyone is on the same team and playing against the board game (spoiler alert: the board game usually wins). Semi-cooperative means for most of the game, everyone works together, but someone can emerge as the overall winner title.</li><li><strong>Number of players:</strong> You want to make sure the board game accommodates the right number of people. If you typically only play with your spouse or friend, check out some two-player options. If you have a regular board-game night with a group of friends, you'll want to check out games that can handle four or more players.</li><li><strong>Learning curve:</strong> The nice thing about Scrabble is pretty much everyone knows how to play. With modern board games, the rules might be very different, and you might have to read the instructions. It's easiest to learn the game if someone present has played it before and can guide you.</li><li><strong>Length of play:</strong> Most board games inform you on the box or instructions about how long it takes to play an average game. Some, you can play in half an hour or less, while others can take hours, and that time only increases the more players there are. Make sure you choose a game that fits the timeframe you normally have available.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=family-friendly-board-games>Family-Friendly Board Games</h2><p>When it's family game night, it's helpful to have a few options that even your younger children can play.
