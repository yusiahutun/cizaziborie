Saturday morning’s low temperature of -22 broke a decades-old record.
It meant bundling uptight as people head out the door.
Even with the bone-chilling freeze, some are on deck to enjoy a game a ball.
This is the 43rd year of the Snowbird Softball Classic supporting Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Mississippi Valley."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Just a totally different type of ball game.”</p><p>It also has players dressing in layers.</p><p>Barry said, “Two pairs of pants on, two pairs of socks and three shirts. Under armor is our friend.”</p><p>It’s because there are very few kind words to say about the temperatures.</p><p>Barry said, “We live an hour away, so we left when it was still negative 20 degrees out and we said let’s get it above zero by the time we get here, and we get here and it’s one degree.”</p><p>It’s all making for a good game, a lot different than expected.</p><p>Morris said, “It was 50 degrees when I signed up, and I knew mother nature was crazy, so I thought by the time we came around to the end of January it might be 60 and boy was I wrong.”</p><p>But nothing will stop some from playing ball.</p><p>Barry said, “Softball is life, ball is life, and it’s been a while since I’ve played. It’s been since November now.”</p><p>Each swing and catch is with a warming purpose, to improve the lives of hundreds of kids.</p><p>Justin said, “It’s a wonderful feeling when you get folks that are willing to come out and do something like this for the kids in our program.”</p><p>While this game might be a one-off, players are hoping the next time they play is a more seasonable game.</p><p>Morris said, “Think going to the gym is being healthy but this is the hardest workout I’ve had in a long time.”</p><p>Fox 18 is a proud sponsor of the Snowbird Classic.</p><p>The event is expected to raise about $10,000.&nbsp;</p><p>A men’s tournament is scheduled for Feb. 8-10.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more, visit the event’s <a href=#>website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46woK2gXaK8s7GMnKalnF2Wu6V50qemsGWfo3qlscKkZJqmnqqurXnSqJ2tmpGhuW7Azq6pp5mdmru1ecyaop6rXay2r8DEq2SpmaKperCyjK2fnmWVrb2mvsiepZydXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
