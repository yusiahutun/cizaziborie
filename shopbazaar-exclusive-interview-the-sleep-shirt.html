I wanted to upgrade my sleepwear (at the time it was an old T-shirt), and the chemise seemed like the perfect item to wear to bed. After a few months of sleeping in it, I decided to create a more modern version and put it into production. My last company was a lingerie brand, and after having dealt with the complications of offering a vast size range of bras, I wanted something simpler. Our classic shirts are one size.</p><img alt="Clothing, Dress shirt, Sleeve, Neck, Outerwear, Collar, Nightwear, Shirt, Blouse, Top, " title="Clothing, Dress shirt, Sleeve, Neck, Outerwear, Collar, Nightwear, Shirt, Blouse, Top, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shortsleepshirt-7-1579724554.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of The Sleep Shirt</span><p>The Exclusive ShopBAZAAR Hero</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">The Sleep Shirt The Exclusive ShopBAZAAR Hero</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$245 at Shop BAZAAR for The Exclusive ShopBAZAAR Hero" data-href=https://shop.harpersbazaar.com/designers/the-sleep-shirt/short-sleep-shirt-blue-oxford-stripe-45992.html data-product-url=https://shop.harpersbazaar.com/designers/the-sleep-shirt/short-sleep-shirt-blue-oxford-stripe-45992.html data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$245 at Shop BAZAAR" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://shop.harpersbazaar.com/designers/the-sleep-shirt/short-sleep-shirt-blue-oxford-stripe-45992.html data-vars-ga-product-brand="The Sleep Shirt" data-vars-ga-product-id=3e1e1901-18f2-4dce-be5d-27e642aa1dec data-vars-ga-product-price=$245.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=61cb4e0d-337c-482f-aa44-ec7bbd644a07 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="The Sleep Shirt" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Sleep Sets" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=harpersbazaar_short-sleep-shirt-blue-oxford-stripe-45992_TSS0300-0001 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="The Exclusive ShopBAZAAR Hero" title="The Exclusive ShopBAZAAR Hero" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1579726116-300_01--IMG_1050_1200--ShortSleepShirtBlueOxfordStripe-999749099.jpg width=1050 height=1200 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">The Sleep Shirt The Exclusive ShopBAZAAR Hero</h2></p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Credit: ShopBAZAAR</span><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Why is the exclusive ShopBAZAAR Hero so special?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Short Sleep Shirt in Blue Oxford Stripe is our original shirt, it’s one of the two items that we offered when we launched the company, and it has been our best seller ever since. This is our favorite fabric, because it softens over time as you break it in, and it lasts forever—I’ve had over 700 wears of mine before they started to wear out.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Any style tips for wearing the exclusive ShopBAZAAR Hero?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This item was originally designed as sleepwear, but it also works as loungewear, daywear, and beachwear—Anne Hathaway was photographed wearing it on the beach! It can be worn as an oversize shirt with jeans or a day dress, and, of course, it is great to sleep in.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What do you want your pieces to achieve for its wearers?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I want our customers to love wearing the product. I feel confident we’ve achieved this because of the high number of customers who come back for more. I often get messages from customers telling me that they love our products, that they are so comfortable, and that they can’t wait to put on their Sleep Shirts for both day and night.</p><img alt="Skin, Beauty, Pink, Flower, Sitting, Forehead, Lip, Plant, Long hair, Smile, " title="Skin, Beauty, Pink, Flower, Sitting, Forehead, Lip, Plant, Long hair, Smile, " width=750 height=501 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/blacklinen-anklelengthsleepshirt-hr-1579726495.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of The Sleep Shirt</span></p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What is a signature Sleep Shirt design trait?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Good-quality fabrics and construction. In this day and age, we just can’t afford to be buying throwaway fashion, so all of our items are constructed so they last hundreds of wears and are made from natural fibers that won’t release microplastics into the waterways when they are washed.</p><img alt="Clothing, White, Fashion model, Dress, Formal wear, Gown, Robe, Neck, Sleeve, Nightwear, " title="Clothing, White, Fashion model, Dress, Formal wear, Gown, Robe, Neck, Sleeve, Nightwear, " width=750 height=1125 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/greyflannel-fulllengthsleepshirt-hr-1579727002.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of The Sleep Shirt</span></p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What sets your brand apart?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unlike many luxury loungewear brands that focus on traditional pajama sets or silky sleepwear, we focus on cotton and linen pieces that are flattering, comfortable, and easy to wear and care for. Our nightshirts are our signature pieces, and people love them because they are beautiful, good quality, and are not skimpy or see-through. They are the types of pieces you can wear at breakfast when you are visiting your in-laws or out to brunch on the weekend with friends.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How would you describe The Sleep Shirt customer?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Our customers vary in age and personalities, but I can tell you five things that she cares about: style, comfort, good-quality clothing, ethically made products, and everyday luxuries.</p><img alt="Clothing, White, Fashion model, Blue, Shoulder, Dress, Turquoise, Neck, Photo shoot, Fashion, " title="Clothing, White, Fashion model, Blue, Shoulder, Dress, Turquoise, Neck, Photo shoot, Fashion, " width=3300 height=4639 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/new-1579727345.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ShopBAZAAR</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">SHOP THE STORY</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiclai2qLrEq6pomWNlg3R8lXFqaKuYpL2jrdmamKtlla2wrcHSoq2eZZmjwaa%2B1aKcsGWknbJuv8uenKllo522s8CO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
