He warned of the threats from plastic waste and chemicals dumped into rivers and seas, and the "air pollution from smoke and fumes discharged by factories and from gases pumped out by endless cars and aeroplanes".</p><p id=eBSbzFD2t2 data-wc=38>The speech was considered extremely radical at the time, though has become even more relevant today. King Charles admitted his views were once "considered rather dotty" yet they still reflect major issues the world is grappling with today.&nbsp;</p><h2>Favouring organic farming</h2><p id=eLq7Umy44K data-wc=30>Over 40 years ago, His Majesty transformed the acres of land at his beloved Highgrove Estate into an organic farm, strictly limiting the use of antibiotics and other harmful chemicals.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0da7cf072998-highgrove-king-charles.jpg><p id=e-PNx_FCbZ9 data-wc=14>At the time, the Prince was called "a complete idiot" for even suggesting it.</p><p id=efHRLzdXOJ data-wc=64>At one of his final engagements as the Prince of Wales, the royal said: "One of the reasons I went organic 40 years ago was because I felt there was an overuse of antibiotics. And I felt that if you overdo it, you end up with resistance. Anyway, that's what happened. I was told I was a complete idiot for even suggesting going organic."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/2f5494c8f772-gettyimages-52103856.jpg><p id=eJK66P5H4a data-wc=27>In 2020, it was announced that the Home Farm lease would not be renewed due to his increasing responsibilities, but he continues to farm organically at Sandringham.</p><h2>Launching the Sustainable Markets Initiative, 2020</h2><p id=eTX6WdQRcg data-wc=37>In his former role as the Prince of Wales, the King launched the Sustainable Markets Initiative in 2020 to accelerate the world's transition to a sustainable future, ensuring businesses work in favour of people and the planet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3c72d3effc4a-gettyimages-52264636.jpg><p id=eRY0TdX6Q_ data-wc=70>"We've got to come together as a world on this," said the monarch of the launch. "I feel very strongly that we have to develop an approach which by putting nature at the centre of the whole process, what profit we make, we have to also make a profit for nature by putting something back. So that my, and your children and grandchild can have some kind of reasonable future."</p><p id=eVD_sL2Xkd data-wc=21>Now, more than 500 CEOs are part of the initiative, including the heads of some of the world’s biggest financial institutions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eating a planet, positive, plant-based diet</h2><p id=ee1LUe41Gs data-wc=26>As well as eating organic produce, which tends to produce far less carbon emissions than regular farming, the King is said to avoid waste wherever possible.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/57b1ad8c73b8-king-charles-eating.jpg><p id=eZ3u1K7Vqs data-wc=67>"I can’t bear any waste, including food waste; I’d much rather find another use. Which is why I’ve been going on for so long about the need for a circular economy, rather than a linear one where you just make, take and throw away – which is a tragedy, because inevitably we over-exploit natural resources that are rapidly depleting," King Charles told Vogue's former editor Edward Enniful.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewD8uWg2LM data-wc=45>King Charles chooses to follow a mainly plant-based diet in order to reduce his carbon footprint. "For years I haven’t eaten meat and fish two days a week and I don’t eat dairy products one day a week," the royal told the BBC in 2021.</p><h2>King Charles' sustainable fashion exhibition</h2><p id=eu7R8IJjfX data-wc=42>The King has been a champion of the 'Positive Fashion' initiative alongside the British Fashion Council's commitment to climate action since its inception in 2018, and will soon launch a sustainable fashion exhibition using recycled materials from his garden at Highgrove House.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c1b1b7df8a49-prince-charles-coat.jpg><p id=e4eCpoc_eg data-wc=27>The exhibition comes as part of the King's ongoing collaboration with designer duo Vin + Omi, who have brought Royal Garden Waste To Fashion’s Future to life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e6906b189d61-king-charles-coat.jpg><p id=ef30-6IwqV data-wc=34>The collection will feature 24 garments and accessories that combine eco-consciousness with innovation, including the world's first maxi dress created using butterbur - an Asian bog plant that grows beside the lakes at Sandringham.</p><h2>Driving a car run on bio-fuel</h2><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: King Charles drives his eco-friendly Aston Martin</figure><p id=e_5MBNanX2 data-wc=57>On his 21st birthday, His Majesty was gifted an Aston Martin by his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II. At the request of the Prince of Wales, the car underwent extensive changes to allow it to run on a biofuel. It uses a combination of English white wine and whey from cheese as a form of fuel.</p><p id=etjkTN84Yj data-wc=61>"The engineers at Aston said, 'Oh, it’ll ruin the whole thing,'" Charles told in 2018. "I said, 'Well I won’t drive it then,' so they got on with it and now they admit that it runs better and is more powerful on that fuel than it is on petrol."And also, it smells delicious as you’re driving along," he added.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
