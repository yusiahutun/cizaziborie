"Really truthfully, I tried to make this extra special for AD and have it look appropriate."</p><p>The 62-year-old also took AD into her favorite room of the house which she lovingly coined as her “toy room”. The cozy sitting room was decorated from top to bottom with stuffed animals, children’s toys and Santa Claus figurines.</p><p>"All of these toys are collected from all of my children," she stated. "Some from me. Some from my little sisters. I'm a toy collector."</p><p>Kathy also pointed out a special toy chest she had received as a gift from the late King of Pop.</p><p>"This toy chest was a gift from Michael Jackson," she said. "This was a toy chest filled with gifts for me for a Christmas maybe 12 years ago. We were both living at the Bel-Air Hotel."</p><p>The Hiltons are huge fans of the holidays, the RHOBH star opened up about some of her family traditions that last over the course of a few days and involve a lot of cooking.</p><p>"Nicky's a good baker," Kathy said and cheekily added that "Paris licks the bowl."</p><p>"In the last couple years, with the pandemic, I felt having my children home a lot more, and especially during Christmas, that we were able to interact together," she admitted that she had come to learn new things about her children by spending this time with them.</p><p>"Sit down with a family member and do some kind of a craft with them," she said. "Bring the things over, bring things that you already have, get a fresh wreath, a fake wreath, whatever. It's the quality time," she stated before she concluded the tour.</p><a id=gallery-link-0595dcd5-6afa-5d2b-8d12-c24407117d84 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:0595dcd5-6afa-5d2b-8d12-c24407117d84 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:570cfa2a-f723-47dc-b970-48a6341ce69c data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6e/4by3/2019/08/07/6e7da31416a25ada8bdf4caace95ace0_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Everett Collection/Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGtma2xfoK61tNhmn6KkpKS7bsDRmqWsnp%2BnurR5x56pZqSfqHqiusaeo56rXZ28rrGMoqWtp12Weri1za2cq2WnpLulsdGlmKecXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
