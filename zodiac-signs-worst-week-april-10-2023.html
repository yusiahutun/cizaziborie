That being said, you could find yourself becoming extra preoccupied with financial matters at the start of the week, especially with Venus entering Gemini and your second house of comfort, security and value systems. More importantly, Venus will be connecting with revelatory Pluto via your 10th house of authority, career and reputation in the world, which adds a smoldering layer to your thoughts, and financial exchanges.</p><p>Given that Pluto governs your relationship sector, this could revolve around a significant other as well. Keep in mind, there will be a sun-Jupiter conjunction happening in your 12th house of secrets and unconscious patterns, suggesting the possibility of you wanting to keep things private, even if it’s for the time being. Shortly after, Venus will face off with taskmaster Saturn in your 11th house of associations, community affairs and visions of the future. This is where your sensual desires and sense of belonging in the world could feel at odds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/virgo4.jpg><p>You’re more likely to hyperfocus on the logistics of a shared asset and/or intimate relationship at the start of the week, as the moon will wander your fourth house of home, family and emotional foundations, and all linking up with expansive Jupiter in the process. Belief systems around a family dynamic could also have you somewhat perturbed, but there’s more. Upon Venus’ ingress into Gemini, the planet of abundance will grace your 10th house of authority, before being confronted by powerhouse Pluto in your sixth house of daily rituals, health habits and day-to-day routines.</p><p>An unexpected reality check is bound to occur, specifically when regarding your professional exchanges and due diligence. To be on the safe side, it’s important to double and triple check your digital security settings, especially those of you bringing work home with you everyday. Venus’ square to Saturn on April 14 could also rock the boat in terms of your professional collaborations, as you could come to terms with the fact that committing to a partnership could potentially compromise your reputation, and/or vice versa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CAP4.jpg><p>Make peace with your past, and broaden your personal horizons. Easier said than done, but with the moon lighting up your sleepy 12th house of unconscious patterns at the start of the week—let alone while connecting with Jupiter in your fourth house of home, family and emotional foundations—there is greater emphasis on your healing journey, and that which brings you the security you crave. The sun will also join Jupiter in this area of your chart (home) the following day, leaving you with no choice but to go inward and look at your family dynamic from a different lens.</p><p>Moreover, after entering your responsible sixth house of due diligence, Venus will connect with shadowy Pluto in your second house of finances, stability and values, which continues to bring light to a routine and/or day-to-day exchange that is ready to be purged, or transformed. After all, when reflecting on your early foundation and sense of security, do you feel that your actions are in alignment with the lifestyle you’re aspiring towards?</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SC-newsletter-banner-.jpeg alt="newsletter banner" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9mom6KZk2R%2BdIKVbW9sZ6qksaqtwmaqop%2BeqHq4u9Gsq2avlZq4bq3Pq6ClZWFlenN8kWxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
