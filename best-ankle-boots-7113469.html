Whether it be a lug-sole <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chelsea boot</a> that you sport on the weekend or a kitten heel bootie that is your go-to for the office during the week, often the best ankle boots see a lot of wear and tear because of their necessity to protect from the elements and provide stability. Since ankle boots are usually treated as workhorses during the length of a calendar season, it’s important to analyze the quality of the boots you are choosing to make the best investment.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since there are so many characteristics to consider — from appropriate heel heights to durability, comfort, and toe shapes — we tapped three experts to help narrow down the most important details that you should be looking out for when selecting the best ankle boots. Of course, fashionability and design details were not discounted in the selection process either.

They’re also snug on the ankle so it's a flattering shape without trying too hard.” Another one of our experts, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dr. Marien Zanyk</a> and creator of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">Anklestone</a>, recommends them as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Blundstone’s Original Chelsea Boots are a sturdy option, made from water-resistant leather. The leather is breathable and molds to your foot shape while being extremely comfortable. The other secret to this classic design is the shock-absorbing power that this flat style offers, thanks to its shock protection technology — which helps reduce fatigue and orthopedic problems in the lower back, feet, and legs. A cushioned midsole adds even more support. “The thoughtful details, such as the double pull tabs and elastic contour, demonstrate a well-considered approach to ease of use and immediate comfort,” Dr. Zanyk adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather; TPU outsole | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-stq-combat-lace-up-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>STQ Combat Lace-Up Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon STQ Combat Lace-Up Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5Q9SzJQjInwbasBvtzFu6E7GBGM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/STQ-Combat-Lace-Up-Boots-5e84f2f891504b34919d75dbb2786cf6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The boots are very comfortable over long periods of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The zipper is on the outside, rather than the inside, which some customers say makes them awkward to take on and off.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Less expensive, these boots offer many features — custom fit laces, a convenient side zipper, reasonably strong, padded, upper ankle support, and a woolen, comfort topper,” Dr. Zanyk explains. “A good deal for the money.” STQ’s combat boot shape is made from vegan leather and has a lace-up front that is typical of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the military-inspired style</a>. “Crafted with style and color choice in mind, this boot combines trendiness with comfort, ensuring a cozy fit,” she adds. Details such as the quilted side panels, knitted ankle cuffs, and slip-resistant soles set this one apart from competitors.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Classic colorways ensure this boot can be paired with everything in your fall and winter wardrobes. We recommend pairing it with a tailored, wool coat, chunky, cashmere turtleneck, floaty maxi skirt, and hosiery for a slightly bohemian look, or with a fair-isle knit, puffer jacket, and jeans for a mountain aprés-ski vibe.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Faux leather; rubber outsole | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-heeled-staud-wally-ankle-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Heeled</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Staud Ankle Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Saks Fifth Avenue Staud Wally Ankle Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4eWnqwJKGnkKxQb1-5Iik7wVH3k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Staud-Wally-Ankle-Boot-fc4e74468d314add83195809be6f4537.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The comfortable, short heel height.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It sells out quickly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“There is a reason these boots have been consistently selling out everywhere and now come in a plethora of colors,” fashion stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Anna Jarema</a> says. Staud’s Wally Ankle Boot is an editor favorite, but fashionistas aren’t the only ones who love this simple, short-heeled boot (with just 2.1-inch heel height). This pointed, rectangular-toed shape is a customer favorite as well with good reason. “Streamlined silhouette to elongate your legs? Check. Added height yet with a realistic walkable heel? Check. Polished, minimal, and versatile, these will earn their cost per wear in any wardrobe,” Jarema calls out. It’s the boot that does it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And since the Wally has garnered such a cult following, it now is available in seven colors, styles, and materials (including suede and matte leather), allowing you to find the ideal boot for your style preference or lifestyle. When it comes to styling, these can be dressed up or down. “They easily work with just about anything from denim and trousers to dresses and skirts,” Jarema notes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Goat leather, leather, abs | <strong>Size: </strong>EU35–EU42<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-everyday-redone-cavalry-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Everyday</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Re/Done Cavalry Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Re/Done Cavalry Boot " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aqOAyp_H-NmWsikm9QhlS3xFaMY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/redone-cavalry-boot-3d57da3d76ce47a8b6a5dbe24edf133f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Re/Done</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s an easy-to-style silhouette with a walkable heel height.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The suede version can be harder to maintain and keep clean.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You might know Re/Done for its vintage-inspired denim, but did you know the brand makes shoes? The Calvary boot is a square-toed, ankle boot that is made in Italy in artisanal factories. The elasticated side panel makes pulling these slip-ons all the easier. Cox especially loves the metal, biker detail that is seen through the silver harness that wraps around this style. The low heel offers a little bit of lift but is short enough to still be walkable, making it an everyday essential.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I love this Re/Done one because it’s a little chunky and really helps bring a dress down to earth,” Cox says. “It lends effortlessness and ease to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>any outfit you pair it with</a> — skirts, dresses, or jeans.” Choose from either black leather or caramel suede and see for yourself how easy it is to style them with everything.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather or suede | <strong>Size: </strong>EU35–EU41<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lace-up-jack-rogers-peyton-bootie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lace-Up</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jack Rogers Peyton Bootie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Jack Rogers Peyton Bootie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5olxTyzF6uxhPmUQ2hg1MO-qR00=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jack-Rogers-Peyton-Bootie-63e88fdfbb1b4c89a139a836d3dd1331.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It features a comfortable insole.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The buckle at the ankle may be uncomfortable for some.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Known for its comfort and versatility, this boot combines style with functionality,” says Dr. Zanyk. Jack Rogers’ Peyton Bootie is a simple, lace-up style that comes in both suede and a matte, glossed leather option. A zippered side allows for easy on and off, without untying the laces every time you pull these on or off. “It is available in a beautiful oak color, as well as black, while offering the moderate heel height to provide a fashionable lift without compromising stability,” she notes. At just 1.2 inches, this heel height is extremely manageable. The lug sole offers grip and traction on everything from slick sidewalks to snowy terrain, so you are sure to have that extra touch of safety.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since the style is a basic silhouette, it can be paired with everything from knit midi dresses to floaty maxi dresses and cropped denim. We're sure it will be a versatile player in your lineup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather; rubber outsole | <strong>Size: </strong>6–11<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 2&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-knitted-vivaia-regina-booties></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Knitted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vivaia Regina Booties</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Vivaia Regina Booties" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fQAgPJHVVR3wRvht0O83wC2BuE0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Vivaia-Regina-Booties-d608e9df8d514c71b495cb21857dfa25.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The warm, water-resistant wool fabrication.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Buyers say that they don't run true to size.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looking for a leather alternative? Vivaia’s Regina Booties are made from a wool upper, which is both water-repellent and warm. The pull-on style is supremely comfortable, featuring a stable, 2.1-inch heel, spacious square toe, and an anti-slip rubber outsole. The best part is the natural Artemisia Argyi herbal insole, which is plant-based and provides pressure relief. The stretchy, wool upper also forms to the foot, so a perfect fit is always found. Cleaning is also quite easy since the uppers and soles can be scrubbed with a cloth both inside and outside.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to styling, we love that these boots can go from day to night with ease. Whether a cropped jean, a wide-leg trouser, or a midi skirt is your bottom of choice, this boot pairs perfectly with any of the above. The harder question really is which color to choose from the extensive line’s range.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Wool; rubber outsole | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 8&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-western-reformation-otto-mini-western-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Western</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Otto Mini Western Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Otto Mini Western Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PU52sNnSETL1hJiyI42VaO5YMgo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Otto-Mini-Western-Boot-f5fb3b9b9a9b4463900919f6e9ed6f63.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The walkable heel height.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It may take some time to break in the leather.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“For that Western spirit in all of us — from city streets to suburban towns — these boots feel timeless and fresh all at once,” Jarema says. Reformation’s Otto Mini Western Boot gives a modern twist to the cowboy boot. The ankle height keeps them from feeling too costumey (compared to, say, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a knee-high</a>), while classic colors and leathers without too many extra frills give them a wearable edge. The 2-inch block heel won’t strain or twist ankles and the snip, pointed toe is true to the cowboy design.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To keep them in the now, be sure to pair these with closet classics that aren’t out of the normal for your style. “Keep it classic and pair them with straight-leg jeans and a tee for the weekend,” Jarema suggests. “Then take them through the seasons with denim shorts and oversized blazers in warmer months.” A look that is very much inspired by Princess Diana is a look we can get behind with fervor.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>4&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-red-wing-heritage-6-classic-moc></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Red Wing Heritage 6" Classic Moc</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Zappos Red Wing Heritage 6&amp;quot; Classic Moc" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vZaETxXVi7Jk_QJfVRUXIv0RZgg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Red-Wing-Heritage-6-Classic-Moc-519dc493f6c146339f9e27e4cf7e5a01.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zappos</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s available in both regular and wide shoe widths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The white sole can get dirty easily.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The Red Wing Moc is just so classic and timeless,” Cox explains. “You can really wear it out and never worry about how to take care of it. The more worn it is, the better.” This boot was made for the rugged outdoors, with full-grain leather that is also water-repellent. This women’s version was constructed with softer leather than the original that dates back to 1952, making for an easier break-in period. However, it is also extremely lightweight, thanks to the signature hydrolysis-resistant polyurethane Traction Tred outsole, making it all the more wearable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cos appreciates the versatility of this heritage boot. “A jean and a sweater, a jacket, and layers work really well with this style or even just a T-shirt,” she says. “It’s truly timeless and you can work outside around the house, go for a hike, or just wear them to a cute casual lunch.

Founded and designed by Lauren Bucquet, an ex-Rag & Bone designer alum, Bucquet launched her own brand with the intention of fulfilling a niche in the direct-to-consumer marketplace.

Featuring a thicker, 2-inch block heel, the boot has a clean design, with a rounded, pointed-toe and an inside zipper closure for easy wear. Handmade in Tuscany, the high-quality leather will just wear well with time and the styling options are endless. Cox appreciates that they’re great for short or long dresses but can also be dressed up or down with jeans or trousers.

This double-buckle, cut-out boot perfectly demonstrates the brand’s unique aesthetic and attention to detail. If you were a fan of its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cowboy boot</a>, then this might be your new favorite.

Loeffler Randall’s Thandy boot was designed with a chic, curved heel that feels very relevant at the moment. The pointed toe and tug, sock-like upper creates a smooth line that is very stylish. A padded footbed ensures that comfort is top of mind, for long hours of wear, and the 2.75-inch heel height is tall enough to give lift but won’t have you in pain all day either.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I think this Loeffler Randall is a great price point for a really chic boot you can get a lot of wear out of,” Cox explains. “This one would look great with a dress and tights or a blazer or all of the above and the little heel shape detail makes it special.” Snag yours before these boots go very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather | <strong>Size: </strong>5–12<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 2&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-narrow-feet-thursday-boot-co-womens-captain-lace-up-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Narrow Feet</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Thursday Boot Co.

The pull-on style also has a wider calf area, for those who are worried about the cut. The rubber sole also will help resist water and the other elements should you encounter.

For work, we would pair a full suit look with these pointy boots and for an easy date night outfit, toss on with a cropped flare jean, turtleneck sweater, and hoop earrings.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cowhide suede | <strong>Size: </strong>EU35–EU42<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 1&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-rain-sorel-womens-out-n-about-iii-classic-duck-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Rain</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sorel Out N About III Duck Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Sorel Out 'n About III Classic Duck Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/keOhXIJ_jO9MRxOK12WrSLwt5B8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sorel-Out-n-About-III-Classic-Duck-Boot-1eac362b855a42f9935e46dc6603e05f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The boot is waterproof.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Most customers wrote the boot runs small.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sorel’s Out ‘N About III boot was made for just that. If you're looking for a fashionable <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rain boot</a>, its waterproof style will allow you to face the elements, with all-day comfort. Whether you’re facing wind, rain, or even light snow showers, the weatherproof exterior and thick, grippy rubber sole make it a great option to keep you stable and sturdy with plenty of traction. This is especially helpful for those city dwellers whose commute often includes a lot of walking. A removable, molded EVA footbed means that comfort won’t be sacrificed when you’re moving in these for hours on end — whether running errands or touring a new city.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Style is not compromised either, for this functional shoe. The lace-up design and thick sole give off a sporty, cool look and there are so many color choices to pick — from plain black to a punchy orange — finding something that fits your personal style aesthetic is easy. We will be pairing these with everything from jeans to cropped trousers, leggings, sweatpants, and more.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather, suede; ethylene vinyl acetate outsole | <strong>Size: </strong>5–12<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 25&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-comfortable-birkenstock-stalon-chelsea-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Birkenstock Stalon Chelsea Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Birkenstock Stalon Chelsea Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/69Spptg8HAukGVHfyFaZssb_5FI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Birkenstock-Stalon-Chelsea-Boot-bf87dde262614fa3a32135adf52d73bf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There’s great arch support for extra comfort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some customers note that the sizing runs small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Comfort is a priority when it comes to any Birkenstock shoe, and the brand’s take on a Chelsea boot offers the same properties you would find in your favorite slides or sandals. Made from water-repellent, oiled nubuck leather, it has a fashionable finish that looks just like any classic boot, but inside, the signature, anatomically shaped, cork-latex footbed makes all the difference. Infamously crafted to mold uniquely to the wearer’s foot, it offers lasting comfort, day after day. Amazing arch support all within a fashion-forward design?

We picture wearing these from work to weekend, with all the classics — denim, trousers, knit dresses, and midi skirts. It’s a truly versatile boot that goes with everything.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Nubuck leather upper, thermoplastic rubber sole | <strong>Size:</strong> EU36–EU46 in Regular and Wide<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 3&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Quality&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The flexibility, yet integrity of the material is important, so choose the best quality that you can afford,” Dr. Zanyk says. “If a boot is made from polyurethane or textile and not from a firm leather, it may not support your ankles adequately.” She also notes the importance of examining the littlest details, as well. “I will always choose a boot design with custom closure, made of quality hooks, eyes, and laces for consistent tightening, from toes up toward the ankle, preferring an additional side zipper for convenience in donning and doffing,” she says. Jarema also makes sure to carefully consider the full scope of the design. “Look for high-quality materials within your budget such as the soles of the boots, fabrication of the shoe, and quality zippers and hardware that will prolong the life of your investment,” she says.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Heel Height</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Zanyk recommends avoiding heels taller than 2 inches. “Whether you prefer a narrow heel or heavy traction lug sole, always avoid heels higher than 2 inches,” she says. “They will shift your body weight forward, causing skeletal malalignment and put great pressure on the ball of the foot and toes, resulting in pain.” This maximum height&nbsp;is ideal to reduce the required range of motion&nbsp;the calf muscles and Achilles tendon need to go through to progress forward. It also could be benefit those who have limited range or who walk a lot in the day and want to reduce the stress, she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Comfort is king,” Cox agrees. “You have to know what type of height you can handle because the tall heel might look good, but if you never reach for it what’s the point?” Keep these points in mind while selecting your best ankle boots.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Toe Shape&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Toe shape is a big consideration for Cox. “Square toe boxes are big right now in terms of trends but you have to consider what kind of clothes you wear and what looks good on your body,” Cox says. “A pointed toe is more elongating and flattering — if you’re not worried about that, go all out on the trends.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Zanyk recommends avoiding narrow toe boxes. “A spacious toe box is essential to prevent crowding, avoiding issues like bunion deformity,” she says. “Remember that no fashion trend is worth the burden it can inflict long term on your alignment, soft tissue, and boney structures.”&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What should people with wide feet look for versus narrow?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Wide feet benefit from boots with a roomier toe box to prevent discomfort,” Dr. Zanyk says.&nbsp;“Avoid the tight toe box, which forces the hallux valgus deformity of the metatarsal and phalangeal bones, resulting in bunions.” She recommends trying Blundstone, LifeStride, and Comfortview boots for a wide fit. “For narrow feet, a snug fit around the heel and instep is crucial to prevent slipping,” she explains. This is best achieved with custom tightening boots, such as lace-ups. She also notes that both groups should prioritize adjustable closures, ensuring a customized fit for optimal comfort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the best pants to wear with ankle boots?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“A cropped flare pant is always great because the contrast of the wider ankle to the skinner ankle of the boot creates a really nice proportion,” Cox suggests. “I'm also a fan of a straight, wide-leg pant with an ankle boot coming out. It feels fresh and effortless if you can pull it off.” Cox likes the ’90s throwback vibe of this styling, crediting Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and her timeless looks for inspiration.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Depending on the heel height, long trousers could look great with a heeled or kitten-heeled bootie and an ankle-cropped pant looks great with any ankle boot,” Jarema says. “Just pay attention that the hem of the pants overlaps the shoe, otherwise you’ll be adjusting it all day.” Playing with proportions is always a good idea.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What color ankle boots go best with blue jeans?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The sky’s the limit when it comes to styling ankle boots with jeans. “Anything goes with blue jeans,” Jarema explains. “Rich suedes and leathers in any tone will always look polished and sleek, while embellished and heeled pairs add an extra layer of spice to your look.” Cox agrees. “White can be good, or black, or brown,” she says. “Blue jeans are neutral, there's not much that doesn't go.”&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Full-time freelance writer and fashion editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kristina Rutkowski</a> has been covering all things style, trend, and shopping for over 10 years.
