Yesterday, the Oscar winner opened the doors to her first retail space, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.atelierjolie.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Atelier Jolie" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Atelier Jolie</a>, in New York City’s SoHo. This isn’t a mere brand extension, though: As with everything Jolie does, there is a humanitarian angle. “We are a collective that aims to show that an ethical and sustainable lifestyle isn’t a lesser life with limitations,” she explained over email from the set of her upcoming Maria Callas biopic. “It is better quality of life, with personal creativity and community at its center."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The store is set in an art-world landmark, 57 Great Jones Street, a carriage house where painter Jean-Michel Basquiat lived and worked in the 1980s, after renting the space from building owner Andy Warhol. The building is recognizable for its front panels, which have been graffitied many times over by local artists and Basquiat fans throughout the decades. When they renovated, the Atelier Jolie team took great care to keep the integrity of the architecture alive. The front panels will remain intact, though they will slide back to reveal glass windows during daytime hours of operation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Further in keeping with the space’s artistic sensibility, the store is partly staffed by students and alumni from Parsons School of Design, three of whom gave me a tour earlier this week. The young artists on her team, Jolie said, are “even more inclined to be bold and disruptive, and that thrills me.”</p><img alt="a building with graffiti on it" title="a building with graffiti on it" width=1440 height=1436 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2023-12-07-at-8-37-14-am-6571db0d9c97e.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Atelier Jolie</span><p>Atelier Jolie’s location at 57 Great Jones Street in New York City—shown here pre-renovation—is known for its facade.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Art-making takes place on the premises, too, as shoppers can work with the team to customize pieces in Jolie’s collection. Made with deadstock and vintage materials, the clothes range from beautifully fluid but sturdy <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a46043309/angelina-jolie-style-trench-coat-hiding-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="trench coats" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">trench coats</a> to crisp suiting and sheer Swiss dot dresses. Customers can pick and choose the pieces they’d like, and one of the team members—all of whom have also been trained in cutting and sewing—will help guide their in-house alterations, including tailoring, patchwork, embroidery, painting, and screen printing. Prices vary, but are democratic: The cost of a jacket with three interchangeable collars is $495, a silk A-line skirt is $195, and a smocked maxi dress starts at $575 and goes up $15 to include or swap out novelty fabrics.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are also simple white T-shirts available for $15 that can be painted, screen printed, or patched. Proceeds from sales of the patches go to charity, and the artists who’ve lent their work to the patches include <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/dukerileystudio/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Duke Riley" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Duke Riley</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/chazguest/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chaz Guest" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Chaz Guest</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/swoonhq/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Swoon class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Swoon</a>. And in addition to the Atelier Jolie base collection, there are collections from sustainable fashion brands Bettter, Simon Ungless, Mitsugu Sasaki, We-Ar4, Mimi Plange, and Justin Smith, all of which can be tailored or altered to your liking.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Performer: Gabby Beans / Directed by Nathan Wiley" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/cd0962bc-d8b2-4d68-a0e1-9d47e50bf207/thumb_1920x1080_00001_1701955747_14219.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Anyone is also welcome to bring in their own vintage or headstock fabrics, and team members will help you create your own one-of-a-kind piece. As sales associate Peter Damas told me, “We want to be able to help them [customers] get something that feels like it’s a quality piece but also something that they created.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“They’re the makers, too,” said Noga Bensch, another sales associate. “They’re part of the creative process.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The back of the ground floor is where the screen printing and patching happen. It is also the only room that isn’t painted white: When the team knocked down the outer walls of this area during renovation, they discovered graffiti-covered surfaces beneath, by all appearances dating back to when Basquiat worked in the building. Downstairs in the basement is the painting room, which is blank now but which they hope to splash with color in the coming months.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Upstairs is the proper atelier space, used for bespoke cutting and tailoring. It is light and airy with exposed wooden beams, three different hand sewing machines, and a back dressing room painted entirely in gold. The furniture and fixtures throughout the building are all upcycled or vintage, and all of the pieces available for purchase are protected by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://fairchain.art/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Fairchain class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Fairchain</a>—“a digital blockchain platform for fine art and collectibles built to strengthen the connection between creators and the stewards of their work,” as the Atelier Jolie team explained in a statement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Atelier Jolie houses its own café, too, run by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eatoffbeat.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eat Offbeat" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Eat Offbeat</a>, a restaurant and catering collective that showcases the cooking talents of NYC’s refugee communities. Within the café, visitors can sit at the craft table (an antique desk) to draw on patches or pick out vintage buttons and lace from the old silver filing cabinet at the back center of the room.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s impossible to walk around the space without noticing the emphasis on creativity and community. As Jolie said, “There is so much happening that divides us, and it’s essential that we create and share time together. One aspect of today’s world is the push to be like others and follow trends. It doesn’t lead to the place where one feels most alive.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added, “Discovery and mistakes are essential for creativity. The once-young punk in me wanted to push against what was normal and paint the walls with the people I love. I hope others do, too.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, here’s an exclusive look at Atelier Jolie’s first collection, now available in the Great Jones space and online, worn by young actors and performers.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Atelier Jolie</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="a person wearing a black shirt" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2023-12-06-at-8-56-24-pm-657126ec11e58.png title="a person wearing a black shirt" width=2440 height=1340 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Brooke Bobb is the fashion news director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.
