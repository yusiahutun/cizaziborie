Hinton. The cast of The Outsiders quickly became teenage heartthrobs. Set in a small town in Oklahoma in 1964, the film centers on a bitter rivalry between two different groups of friends, the Greasers, who come from broken homes on the poor side of the tracks, and the Socs, who are born into wealth and privilege. Shot in Tulsa, The Outsiders was a low-budget film that became a box office success, thanks in large part to a cast of charismatic actors who soon became household names.</p><p>The Outsiders continues to be a timeless classic as schools across the country have put the book on its required reading list. The book and movie’s lessons about acceptance, the impact of hatred and anger, and the significance of staying true to yourself remain just as relevant today as they were when the film was released 40 years ago. Here’s a look back at the unforgettable cast of The Outsiders, a powerful coming-of-age story.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-583654004-e1696866760859.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tom Cruise as Steve Randle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/1-1.png><p>Although <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Cruise</a> got bit by the acting bug in high school, he briefly diverted onto a different path when he enrolled in seminary school to become a Catholic priest. After reportedly getting kicked out, Cruise jetted off to New York and then Los Angeles to pursue a career in show business where he landed small roles in the movies Taps and Endless Love before getting his big break as Steve Randle in The Outsiders.</p><p>That performance (and his good looks) lead to bigger roles in Risky Business and All the Right Moves. In 1986, Cruise starred in the blockbuster Top Gun as Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell and then went on to headline the Mission Impossible movie series in the ’90s. He was also in The Color of Money with Paul Newman, A Few Good Men with Demi Moore and Jack Nicholson, and Jerry Maguire with Cuba Gooding Jr. In 2022 Cruise produced and starred in the Top Gun sequel Top Gun: Maverick, which made over $1 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of his long career.</p><p>Like his Top Gun persona, Cruise is also a real-life pilot and got his license to fly in 1994. Now 61, he’s long been one of the world’s highest-paid actors, and he’s kept a devoted fanbase despite his often-tumultuous personal life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Matt Dillon as Dallas “Dally” Winston</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/2-1.png><p>Who knew cutting class in school could be the lucky ticket to stardom?
