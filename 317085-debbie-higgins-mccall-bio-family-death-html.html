There is little regarding her family and siblings, but she was raised by both parents. Her father was a farmer, while her mother was a housewife.</p><p class=align-left>Even though she was brought up in a lower-middle-class family, her hardworking spirit and determination were sufficient enough as she managed to clear both her high school and college education. She attended the New York High School and afterward attended the Massachusetts Institute of Commerce.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/483729bba3922993.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beth Thomasâ€™ bio: What happened to her and her siblings?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It can be said of her that she was proactive, something that immensely contributed to her involvement in various physical activities such as playing volleyball, singing, dancing, cheerleading, and even playing soccer. Her high energy and high-spirited approach to things saw her rise the ranks in school to being one of the most resourceful students.</p><p class=align-left>Her early marriage soon after school was a significant detour in her blossoming career. She started as a gifted editor evidenced through her work in the films such as Demon Hunters: Fear the Silence and Christ Mathewson Day. She was able to build her career from the ground up satisfactorily, but all that was cut short following her divorce and later death.</p><p class=align-left>While she established her modest career as a reputable editor, her ex-husband was equally creating a soon to be show on TV, Dr. Phil.

The first marriage to her high school girlfriend and lover Debbie Higgins McCall ended in a sour tone after the duo divorced, barely three years after their wedding in 1970. According to sources <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">close to the family</a>, Debbie was unhappy about the domestic abuse she suffered during the marriage. Some of the unlikely occurrences included the restrictions from Phil against her freedom of movement and other forms of physical abuse.</p><p class=align-left>Dr. Phil has since made steps in his relationship life after marrying Robin McGraw in 1976. Ever since their marriage, the duo has been blessed with two children, Jay McGraw, and Jordan McGraw.

Shortly after, Phil began to act against the beliefs of Debbie by restricting her from making regular movements and physical abuse. Also, Phil was involved in instances of infidelity, something that spurred Debbie's decision to seek divorce eventually. The marriage was officially annulled in 1973 and gave the once couple the freedom to pursue other interests and partners.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6db0ed81f0d34c2e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beatrice Marshall bio: Full names, family, current job, facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With Debbie officially estranged to Phil and the two no longer tied to any relationship commitment, Phil advanced to being a national figure through his television show.
