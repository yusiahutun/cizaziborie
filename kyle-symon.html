After he relocated to East Hampton, New York, from Cleveland, his proposal gained momentum. He worked three years at a historical society charity shop to pay the bills before he could afford a storefront in Sag Harbor. He also wanted to start a coffee business, so he went to Michael for advice. He was urged by Michael to add sandwiches and doughnuts to his menu.
