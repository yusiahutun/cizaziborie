Their business deal also comes at a challenging time for the champagne industry, which saw sales of the drink fall by a fifth due to a decline in events, celebrations, and the shattering of the restaurant industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://wwd.com/business-news/mergers-acquisitions/lvmh-buys-50-percent-jay-z-champagne-brand-armand-de-brignac-ace-of-spades-1234741514/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=WWD class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">WWD</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We had been following its success over the last few years and we thought, this is crazy. Most Champagne brands see very modest growth, and he was just shooting up through the ranks. We tasted the Champagne and we said, yes, there is something to be done together," said Philippe Schaus, chief executive officer of Moët Hennessy, in an interview with WWD. "We are already global leaders with our prestige Champagne brands—Dom Pérignon, Krug and the prestige cuvées of Veuve Clicquot and Ruinart—but Armand de Brignac has created another niche and in some respects revolutionized the prestige category, so we wanted to be part of that. They opened Champagne to a new clientele, so in that sense, it's a great complement to our portfolio."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
