Not only do street style stars enjoy using this in-between shoe to complete their outfits, but the trend has also been&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spotted on runways</a>&nbsp;since last season. IRL, kitten heels happen to be incredibly versatile. Since they're both comfortable and elevated, they have the ability to pull double duty, taking the place of either flats or higher heels. Whether you choose to wear them with jeans or a sequined skirt, kitten heels are a playful, unexpected choice that works every time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, we've rounded up 10 kitten heel outfits that just might make you fall in love with this slight height-boosting shoe.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-easy-dresses></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With Easy Dresses</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Looking for a footwear option to complement your favorite breezy dress? Kitten heels are a small step up from flats. Compared to sky-high stilettos, they're easier for walking, balancing, and wearing throughout the night.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-loungewear></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With Loungewear</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Streetstyleshooters / Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We may enjoy dressing up, but the truth is, some days call for leggings and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>loungewear</a>. Kitten heels can make stretchy staples seem sleeker and somewhat fancy — especially if you add something structured to your look, such as an oversized button-down or blazer.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-timeless-neutrals></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With Timeless Neutrals</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, trends work on a rotating basis, but there's a reason this shoe is never "out" for long. Kitten styles are subtle and sweet, but pointed-toe options work to elongate your legs, just like higher heels. Invest in a neutral pair you can hold onto for years to come.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-sparkly-skirts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With Sparkly Skirts</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They may be small, but these heels still have the ability to make a major statement.
