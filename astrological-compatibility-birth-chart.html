From the most casual horoscope readers to veterans who read charts professionally, more and more people are using their&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>birth charts</a>&nbsp;as a tool for getting a read on love compatibility.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's one popular pitfall: All too often, people will assume they can judge compatibility on sun signs alone.

Below are the main rules for decoding whether or not there's love compatibility based on your birth chart.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-consider-the-planets-of-love-and-sex></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Consider the Planets of Love and Sex</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you look at a potential partner's chart (which you can calculate on a variety of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>free birth chart sites</a>), you'll want to note not only their sun sign but their:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Moon Sign</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The moon is the emotional compass of your chart, shaping your sense of safety and security, values, and intuition. When you express how you feel in your heart of hearts, it's coming from your moon sign. It's how you nurture — and want to be nurtured.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Venus Sign</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The planet of love, romance, money, beauty, and art, a person's&nbsp;natal Venus&nbsp;speaks to the way you relate to others and express desires and passions. It colors what you value and how you relate to and experience pleasure and influences how you socialize and attract people.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Mars Sign</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mars</a>, the go-getter planet, speaks to how you take action, your energy, sexual expression, and courage. It's also how you contend with and display anger and passion.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-consider-the-planets-of-abundance-and-boundaries></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Consider the Planets of Abundance and Boundaries</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Rising Sign</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sign ascending on the eastern horizon at the time of your birth is considered&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>your rising or ascendant</a>. It speaks to the image you project out into the world and offers insight into the skills, talents, and strategies you might adopt to make your way in life.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Jupiter Sign</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jupiter is the planet of expansion and abundance. It speaks to how you make your luck and experience fortune, so it's often an astrological compatibility factor for couples who simply feel luckier — or literally experience more luck in life — as a result of being together.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Saturn Sign</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Saturn is the planet of boundaries, limitations, and hard work. Your natal Saturn placement speaks to the lessons you need to learn in this life. It's important to consider when you're thinking about long-term relationship compatibility. As the planet of commitment and structure, it provides that stick-to-it mentality you'll need to make it through.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-consider-the-connections></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Consider the Connections</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you've pinpointed the signs that each of these romance planets is in for your love interest, check out the degrees. Every sign spans 30 degrees. Placements sitting 10 degrees or fewer between one another are worth taking note of — and the closer they are, the stronger the aspect will be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In general, you'll want to think about how your potential partner's placements "talk" to your placements. It's not just about checking to see if their moon sign is in the same sign as yours or in a compatible element. Think about how their big six (aka personal placements) connect with your big six — and also Jupiter and Saturn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here are the aspects that speak to a harmonious bond:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Conjunction</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is when two placements are in the same sign, which can be a strong show of like-mindedness. Let's say one person's natal Pluto conjuncts the other's natal Jupiter in&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Libra</a>, the sign of partnership. This emphasizes the theme of growth between them. If one's Neptune is conjunct the other's Mars in&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Sagittarius</a>, it can promote a rose-colored glasses vibe between them — especially in sex.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Trine</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is when two placements are four signs — or 120 degrees — apart. This speaks to a shared element, which means that the two of you will get along very well. If you need a refresher, here are the signs in each element:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sextile</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When placements are two signs — or 60 degrees — apart, they form a sextile, which promotes a friendly, easygoing, and lighthearted connection. It also feels more like an invitation to hit it off versus an immediate, obvious bond.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here are the signs that sextile one another:</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Aries: </strong>Gemini, Aquarius</li><li><strong>Taurus: </strong>Cancer, Pisces</li><li><strong>Gemini: </strong>Aries, Leo</li><li><strong>Cancer: </strong>Taurus, Virgo</li><li><strong>Leo: </strong>Gemini, Libra</li><li><strong>Virgo: </strong>Cancer, Scorpio</li><li><strong>Libra:</strong> Leo, Sagittarius</li><li><strong>Scorpio: </strong>Virgo, Capricorn</li><li><strong>Sagittarius: </strong>Libra, Aquarius</li><li><strong>Capricorn: </strong>Scorpio, Pisces</li><li><strong>Aquarius: </strong>Aries, Sagittarius</li><li><strong>Pisces: </strong>Taurus, Capricorn</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-planetary-connections-that-may-indicate-major-romance></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Planetary Connections That May Indicate Major Romance</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following aspects between particular placements — what's referred to as synastry — could be a sign that you're astrological soulmates:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sun Conjunct Moon</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When one person's core identity is the same as the other's emotional compass, it's easy to form the kind of partnership in which you can't help but understand one another intuitively.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sun Trine or Sextile Sun</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sun trine sun will make for pretty immediate and obvious sparks, while the sun sextile sun connection might be a little less obvious at first but can also offer a hefty dose of harmony.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Moon or Venus Conjunct Ascendant</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If one person's moon — aka emotional compass — or Venus, which speaks to what they're attracted to, is aligned with the other's ascendant or rising sign, chances are they're going to be attracted to one another from the start.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the rising or ascendant person, the moon or Venus person sees what resonates with their heart or perception of beauty. The rising person finds the moon or Venus person super attractive as well — in part because they organically get and appreciate them.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Venus Conjunct, Trine, or Sextile Mars</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Venus is the planet of love, and Mars is the planet of sex, so the two together usually indicate equal parts romance and fireworks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A conjunction is off-the-charts hot from the get-go because the way one of you expresses your love language is the same as how the other expresses sexual desire. A trine makes for an organic understanding of one another's love style and needs between the sheets. The sextile can be a bit more of a slow burn — think a friends-with-benefits situation that ultimately becomes a heartfelt love affair.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8Csq6unnKS0unvArKurp5yktKqvwKVknKedpa61tcGio6KsqWKvqr7ToWScoJGnwQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
