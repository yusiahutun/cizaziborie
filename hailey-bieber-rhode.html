After months (years?) of teasing us, <a href=#>Hailey Bieber’s skincare line is finally here. Rhode</a> is out with three products and much, much more to come. We’ve watched her use the glowy-skin products on TikTok and heard all about the way she enlisted other beauty founders for advice and really put her whole heart into this line. This doesn’t seem like a random beauty brand she just decided to put her name on. Rhode is a part of her. (It’s also her middle name.)</p><p>You’ve heard enough teasing though. It’s time to get to the goods. First, it’s important to know who Bieber is. She has <a href=#>sensitive skin</a> and favors a no-makeup makeup look with healthy skin first and foremost. That’s what this line is about. It’s almost all fragrance-free (when that’s most important) and entirely cruelty-free with formulas safe for sensitive skin. The brand is focusing on “restoring and nourishing the skin barrier” a.k.a. healthy skin that glows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220125_RHODE_SHOT_02_0907_v2_C3.jpg><p>Like <a href=#>Rare Beauty</a>, there’s a charitable element, too. (We love these women.) Rhode has committed a minimum of 1 percent of sales to the Rhode Futures Foundation which supports women and their families through the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Accion Opportunity Fund</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Black Mamas&nbsp;Matter Alliance</a> and the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">LIFT Communities Family Goal Fund</a>. I love that Bieber is doing&nbsp;this right from launch. It’s obviously an important part of her brand.</p><p>As for the products, they’re not super exciting but that might actually be a good thing. When it comes to healthy skin, it’s all about protecting your moisture barrier and not breaking it down with a high percentage of actives and acids and exfoliators. These three products won’t do that.</p><p>First, let’s look at the Peptide Glazing Fluid. It’s a lightweight serum gel that contains brightening niacinamide, plumping peptides, fatty acid-rich marula oil and moisture-locking <a href=#>hyaluronic acid</a>. Apply this after you cleanse your skin and before applying moisturizer. It retails for $29 — a great price for what you’re getting here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RHODE-PDPs0560.png><p>It seems a bit basic but the Barrier Restore Cream is what I’ve been loving on my own skin. As a woman in my 30s, I all of a sudden have <a href=#>acne-prone skin</a> and hydration is the hardest part of my routine. This surprisingly rich moisturizer contains what looks like zero pore-clogging ingredients. I know Bieber has dealt with breakouts in the past so I’m sure this is purposeful. And it’s much appreciated.</p><p>Barrier Restore Cream also contains niacinamide and peptides, as well as hydrating shea butter, soothing squalane and antioxidant-rich açaí. The $29 price tag is especially great here. There’s not a lot on the market for this price and these ingredients.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RHODE-PDPs0536.png><p>Finally, there’s the last product in the launch and the most, well, boring. Sure, I love <a href=#>lip balm</a> as much as the next millennial but I need something more from this brand considering the hype. Still, Peptide Lip Treatment is nice. It contains shea butter, peptides, capuaçu&nbsp;and babassu, which all amounts to a very hydrating, softening and even skin-protecting formula. It’s $16 and comes in Fragrance-free, Salted Carmel and Watermelon Slice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RHODE-PRPDUCT-SHOOT2386.png><p>As I said, it’s nice. I just wanted an <a href=#>eye cream</a> or toner or face wash — something to give this line a well-rounded feel. I guess I just have to be patient because there’s so much more to come from the brand. Soon, we’ll have an entire skincare routine to get that donut-like, glazed skin look Bieber does so well.
