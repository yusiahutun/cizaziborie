I’m happy to announce that Insomniac will bring the Okeechobee Music & Arts Festival back to Sunshine Grove,” said Insomniac Founder & CEO Pasquale Rotella. “I’m a big fan of what Rechulski and the Okeechobee team have built, and honored to be able to lead such a unique event and continue the journey. This is one of the most beautiful locations I’ve ever set foot in. As someone who tries to always put culture first, I recognize how passionate this extraordinary community is, and I’m excited to bring this festival back and make it better than ever.”</p><p>“It is an exceptional honor to have had the opportunity, luck, and responsibility of creating and caring for OMF,” added Rechulski, Soundslinger’s Founder. “I would like to thank my partners and the rest of the Soundslinger staff, the County and people of Okeechobee for welcoming us with open arms, all of our vendors and contractors, and most importantly all of the incredibly dedicated and colorful Okeechobeeings, our loyal fans.”</p><p>Rechulski further commented, “I am so excited once again to enter the portal alongside Pasquale Rotella and the Insomniac team. The best years are ahead of us, and I am certain that together we will continue our beautiful story for many more years to come with the same love, hard work, commitment, community engagement, and respect that have been the foundation of OMF.”</p><p>According to an official release, OMF 2020 will kick-off an immersive lineup of interactive offerings on Thursday, March 5 during a nighttime pre-party.&nbsp; Each day, Chobeewobee Village will feature an eclectic mix of immersive art, food & beverage offerings, performances, yoga classes, life enhancing workshops, speakers, as well as its signature artisan vendors in a bazaar-style experience. Also on site, a 24-hour general store, 24-hour food options, showers, free portalets, and local and craft food and beverage options complete the all-inclusive experience.</p><p>In addition to OMF’s three main stages—Be, Here and Now—dance music lovers will gravitate once again towards Jungle 51, a dusk till dawn dance party nestled in the heart of the jungle that has hosted some of the biggest names in house and techno in recent years. OMF attendees will also be able to take advantage of Aquachobee Beach, where they will once again have the chance to catch daytime live music sets while swimming and sunbathing.</p><p>Passes are on-sale for all ticket and camping types beginning August 23 at 10am ET at&nbsp;<span><a href=#>okeechobeefest.com</a></span>.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoZwfJdoaHJnmaPAsLnNopicZaCWv7W6xKuqZq%2BZqbVuv86upZ2rnJ67qLHRZp2oql2ptaZ50Z6rrqqeYrynec6knJ6bmKSvprGMpqysoZNirrPA0madnquknsOiuIytpmarpaPAqbXNnmSgqp%2BrsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
