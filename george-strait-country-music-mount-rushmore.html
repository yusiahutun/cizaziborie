Who&nbsp;would you&nbsp;select? Few country fans will agree on all four, even if most will agree on one or two.</p><p><a href=#>Dolly Parton</a> and <a href=#>Hank Williams</a> seem likely to hold two of the four spots. At various points it'd be easy to argue for legends including&nbsp;<a href=#>Johnny Cash</a>, <a href=#>Merle Haggard</a> and <a href=#>Garth Brooks</a> — heck, maybe it still is!</p><p>Strait's career path has been a slow and steady rise through five decades, and that complicates things.</p><h3>Here's Why George Strait Belongs on Country Music's Mount Rushmore:</h3><p>George Strait has more No. 1 hits than any of&nbsp;the above artists. He's now in his fifth decade of music making, and the records feel as timeless as Strait Country did in 1981.</p><p>Beyond that, ask any contemporary&nbsp;male artist who had the greatest influence&nbsp;on him and you'll hear Strait's name&nbsp;first, second or third. He seems to be leaning into that in 2024. In the video above, ToC's Billy Dukes notes how newcomers are sharing stories about Strait like never before, especially those from Texas.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>Is George Strait Releasing New Music With Chris Stapleton?</a></p><h3>Here's Why George Strait&nbsp;Doesn't Belong on Country Music's Mount Rushmore:</h3><p>The case against Strait doesn't have much to do with him. There are just four spots, and plenty of people with a subjective case for it. ToC put the question to fans and heard names including Reba McEntire, Willie Nelson, George Jones, Ronnie Milsap, Loretta Lynn, the Oak Ridge Boys, Hank Williams Jr., Jimmie Rodgers and Alan Jackson.</p><p>"Not only does George Strait belong on the mountain, I think he’d be second to only Merle Haggard," writes @hfled on YouTube. "The argument would come down to who was third and fourth. Probably Dolly and Hank Sr, but you could make a case for others like George Jones and Loretta Lynn."</p><p>Others like @Dirtydeff scored it differently.</p><p>"Hank Williams, George Strait, Garth Brooks, and Hank Williams Jr. Not all are my favorites but I think they have had the most record sales/influence etc ..."</p><p>Strait is in a unique position because his career isn't over with. In fact, there are signs he could be positioning himself for a big year or few years, maybe even in the way Parton just did with her Rockstar album. Part of why we think an artist is great after he or she dies is because someone was there to curate the legacy (see Elvis Presley vs. someone like Jerry Lee Lewis). Brooks & Dunn are another act that took advantage of this when they assembled the Reboot album in 2019.</p><p>Should Strait release a few more albums, earn some critical acclaim and maybe even win a Grammy, and allow people to laud him in a big way, his profile would rise. There isn't a George Strait museum or a bar / honkytonk with his name on it, and there should be.</p><p>Even if you don't think he's Mount Rushmore-worthy, you have to agree there's Mount Rushmore potential.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: Look Inside George Strait's Spectacular Mansion</h2><p>George Strait has sold his one-of-a-kind mansion in Texas, and it was actually a real deal. The country legend asked $6.9 million for his 7,925-square-foot home that includes three bedrooms, four full bathrooms and two half-baths on a hilltop in a very exclusive area of San Antonio. The final selling price was not disclosed.</p><p>The house sits on 12.2 acres and includes a gourmet kitchen, separate his and her bathrooms and closets and 14 hand-sculpted masonry fireplaces. The main house is wired for surround sound throughout, and it also features outdoor living spaces including a patio with built-in grill, sink, icemaker and refrigerator. There's also an infinity pool/spa and a sports court, a workout room with a private bathroom and sauna, and a walk-in safe room.</p><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: <a href=#>Sterling Whitaker</a></p><h2 class=photogallery-title>50 Classic Country Artists Today’s Fans Should Know</h2><p>Today's country music stars owe a debt of gratitude to the legends who formed and cultivated the genre, starting in the early 20th century. These 50 classic country artists remain relevant today. Some developed a style that's emulated on today's country radio.
