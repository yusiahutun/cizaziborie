13 Going on 30 stars Jennifer Garner, Mark Ruffalo and Judy Greer staged a virtual reunion for the 20th anniversary of the film, sharing the video with excited fans on Tuesday afternoon.
While there were a few technical difficulties during the call -- at one point, Judy sounded like she had a mouth full of marbles, noted Ruffalo -- it was beyond sweet to see the trio recall some of their memories from the set two decades after the romcom's 2004 release."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Though it seemed like he was about to say the size of the fandoms are equal, he ultimately said he gets "way more" love for the comedy.</p><p>"A woman came up to me yesterday and told me that her and her friends do 13 Going on 30 cosplay," he added, before Garner exclaimed that she had just met a baby named after her character, Jenna Rink, from the movie.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7577e49f-2232-4cd1-aee9-1e8dc5c8cee1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d42edc07-e9ca-462b-a89a-2a503f9b92a8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a1/5by4/2021/11/11/a1f975b013484db6b0eadd40de3ea291_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">TikTok</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">13 Going on 30 Star Christa Allen Turns 30, Interacts with Teenage Self In Short Video Series</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The biggest surprise of the conversation, however, came for Greer -- who, at one point, exclaimed, "<a href=#><strong>Brie Larson</strong></a> was in our movie?!?"</p><p>That's right, Ruffalo's fellow Avenger -- Captain Marvel herself -- was just a teenager when she appeared in the flick, playing one of the unnamed Six Chicks in the '80s-set scenes. To be fair, Ruffalo also didn't put two and two together <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>until someone pointed it out to him</strong></a> on the red carpet in 2019, at the premiere of Avengers: Endgame.</p><p>The video ended with the trio thanking fans for the love over the years, with Ruffalo saying their supporters have "been the best fans of this movie that anyone could possibly have." The three then toasted to another 20 years ... before sharing a trick for taking a truly great photo.</p><p>"Twenty years. We are three Boomers braving zoomâ€”because we want to thank you. ðŸ‘´ðŸ‘µðŸ‘µ," Garner captioned the video. "To every person who has loved this movie along with us: Thank You. We see you, we appreciate you and we love you back. Forever thirty, flirty and thriving! ðŸ’•"</p><p>See what the rest of the film's cast looks like below:</p><a id=gallery-link-4d72d1fb-08c3-5fc2-b2e8-c79687327b69 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:4d72d1fb-08c3-5fc2-b2e8-c79687327b69 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:d42edc07-e9ca-462b-a89a-2a503f9b92a8 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/23/4by3/2019/04/23/23e3da718543592b941415f1db46bdf6_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Everett Collection/Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma2tfZoBus86ipaBln6N6dHyMq5yuppmku25%2Bj62fZpmeo7a3sdGsmKuxXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
