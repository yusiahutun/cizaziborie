Here's a quick rundown:</p><ul data-node-id=12 class="css-yzf9pi et3p2gv0"><li><strong>Nordmann Fir</strong> –The Nordmann Fir boasts great symmetry and has soft, non-drop needles in a rich, deep green colour, the perfect backdrop for your sparkly baubles.</li><li><strong>Norway Spruce</strong> – This Christmas tree classic has a great fragrance but you’ll need to keep on top of watering to prevent it shedding its needles.</li><li><strong>Blue Spruce</strong> – For something a little different, opt for this sturdy tree with a striking pale blue hue.</li><li><strong>Fraser Fir</strong> – Ideal for more compact spaces, the Fraser Fir has dark green foliage with silvery-blue undertones, a pleasant scent and great needle retention. It has slightly upward facing branches – ideal dangling material for tinsel or lights.</li><li><strong>Serbian Spruce</strong> – An elegant tree sporting great needle retention and dark green needles with a silvery underside laid out on thickly layered branches - perfect for the maximalist with an endless supply of decorations to hang.</li></ul><h2 title="When is the best time to visit a Christmas tree farm?

Aim to visit the farms on a weekday, when they’re likely to be quieter. If you’re going for a cut tree, it’s best to wait until the end of November or December if you can, otherwise your tree may start looking a bit forlorn come Christmas time. Pre-cut trees can last around four weeks.</p><img alt="christmas tree farm uk" title="Christmas Tree Farm UK" width=1333 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/christmas-tree-farms-654e774a0c982.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-o6q7mr e6iqukd2">Country Living|Nato Welton</span></p><h2 title="Best Christmas tree farms to visit in the UK" data-anchor-id=best-christmas-tree-farms-to-visit-in-the-uk class="body-h2 css-ehc3s eqwrocx1">Best Christmas tree farms to visit in the UK<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><strong>FRIEZELAND CHRISTMAS TREE FARM – WARWICKSHIRE</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">You’ll be spoilt for choice at the UK’s largest Christmas tree farm, which supplies the likes of John Lewis and the PM’s residence with specimens from its festive fields in Warwickshire (the wreath in prime position outside Number 10 this year will come from Friezeland).

While you can order online, strolling through their fragrant Christmas tree forest, surrounded by Devon countryside, is a real treat.

Some of the Christmas tree farms we’ve listed offer local home delivery – but if you’re planning on getting yours home yourself, bring strong twine or bungee cord to secure your tree to your car's roof or boot. Protect your car's interior and exterior with a dust sheet, as pine needles and sap can be messy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Jo says a common mistake people make is taking the tree straight into the house. For the early birds, a word of caution: “only buy/take the tree into your home when you need it. Until then, leave it outside in a bucket of water in a shaded/sheltered area. Once you’ve brought it into your house, put it into your stand and the last thing you do is remove the protective netting.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">As you might expect, evergreen trees aren’t big fans of central heating so, if you notice the needles dropping, move it away from your radiators. And remember to water!</p><h2 title="Are Christmas tree farms bad for the environment?" data-anchor-id=are-christmas-tree-farms-bad-for-the-environment class="body-h2 css-ehc3s eqwrocx1">Are Christmas tree farms bad for the environment?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Sussing out your Christmas trees’ eco credentials isn’t as straightforward as you might think. The carbon footprint of fake plastic trees is said to be around 20 times higher than real trees. But a real tree that ends up in landfill isn’t great either, emitting some four to five times as much carbon as one that doesn’t, according to Carbon Trust figures.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Christmas trees are often grown on soil that doesn’t support other crops, and a Christmas tree farm can help prevent flood risk and attract wildlife. We suggest searching for organically grown varieties, if you’re worried about overuse of pesticides and fertiliser, or buy a potted tree you can plant out at a later date.</p><img alt="christmas tree farm uk" title="christmas tree farm uk" width=546 height=528 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2023-11-10-at-18-27-30-654e762a96a8b.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-o6q7mr e6iqukd2">The British Christmas Tree Growers Association</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Additionally, you can look out for the BCTGA logo. This is a sign the farm is committed to growing Christmas trees as sustainably as possible. Jo says BCTGA members take steps to “care for wildlife and the environment, which include timing mowing, cultivations, hedge cutting, crop protection and crop shearing to limit soil erosion and have minimum effect on wildlife, particularly nesting birds.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Jo suggests also keeping the following things in mind to ensure your tree has its ethics nailed down.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“Firstly, buy directly from the farm if possible where the trees were grown.
