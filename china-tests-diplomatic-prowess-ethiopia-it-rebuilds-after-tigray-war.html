China pledges food, funds to key Horn of Africa partner Ethiopia
Tigray and Afar were the regions most affected by the Tigray war, which broke out in November 2020 when Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces attacked the Northern Command headquarters of the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF), as well as a number of other bases in Tigray."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Given that this was when Ethiopia’s and China’s economic relationship strengthened considerably, China has at the very least a historical connection to the TPLF,” Fiala added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said while China was not the main actor in the African Union-led peace process, positive economic signalling from Beijing could support the ongoing efforts to facilitate lasting stability in Ethiopia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fiala added that the key question was whether promises of further investment would materialise in time without simultaneously increasing Ethiopia’s debt burden.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Lasting debt relief would be another influential tool Beijing could use to support Ethiopia’s economic recovery,” he said.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/11/17/web_clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:16</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">What is behind the fighting in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region?</p><p>What is behind the fighting in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the sidelines of the Brics summit in August, Xi promised to suspend Ethiopia’s payments on debt maturing in 2023 and 2024 as part of the common framework for debt restructuring.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Between 2000 and 2022, China pledged US$14.1 billion in loans to Ethiopia, according to data from Boston University’s Global Development Policy Centre. Beijing funded the building of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway, which is part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, as well as the Addis Ababa light rail.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Seifudein Adem, a global affairs professor at Doshi­sha University in Japan, said China realised Ethiopia’s “immense potential” and wanted the country to move quickly to end its conflicts and ensure that Ethiopians could “enjoy the fruits of peace and prosperity”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said Beijing’s involvement in the peace process would help it learn about the dynamics of conflict management, conflict resolution and peacemaking.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As a rising global power, China seeks to enhance its experience in these areas. The experience thus gained will prove helpful for her in other parts of Africa and elsewhere. In this sense, the process is as important for China as the outcome,” Adem said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He added that the Horn of Africa is an ideal place for gaining this experience, as it is home to old and new states, interstate conflicts and internal conflicts, conflicts over resources and conflicts over identity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Horn of Africa is also a geostrategic magnet for major global powers, which is perhaps why Xue was appointed special envoy for the region the first place, Aden said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese envoy to Horn of Africa rejects foreign intervention</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to David Shinn, a professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs in Washington and former US ambassador to Addis Ababa, Chinese companies were engaged in several construction and manufacturing projects in the Tigray region valued at over US$4 billion before the conflict broke out. Beijing had to evacuate personnel associated with those projects.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Presumably, it would like to resume those activities,” he said, adding that China had also been a major source of loans for Ethiopia, although they had declined significantly in recent years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China consistently called for an end to the fighting in Ethiopia and encouraged dialogue but otherwise played a minor role in the peace process.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shinn said much of the reconstruction funding would have to come from Ethiopia’s own resources.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Ethiopians created this tragedy and the international community expects them to take the lead in recovering from it,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“To the extent the international community contributes to the effort, it will have to be largely in the form of aid and not loans that add to Ethiopia’s already extensive external debt.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyltc%2BlpqaZk658or7TopqlnV9of3WBknBtaJuYnruiedOeqq2rXZm2sbjOppitoZNivbO71p6qrGWVqbWqu8%2BimGahpGK%2Fpq7UoqOdq12Ws7Wx0Warop%2BilsZuw8Cr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
