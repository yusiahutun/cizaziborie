As a result, thousands are needlessly getting powerful drugs designed to calm them down, she said.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition which affects people's behaviour. It usually makes patients restless and causes them trouble concentrating and act on impulse."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Moncrieff said social media platforms like <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-048f1610-cc20-11ee-8cea-89aeee9204a7>TikTok</a>&nbsp;had 'a huge part' to play in promoting ADHD to the masses.</p><p

American Katie Sue who says she was diagnosed with ADHD at 29, lists signs of the condition as including 'mystery bruises', 'coming across as a flirt', 'having low esteem' or 'forgetting about food

ways.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Professor Moncrieff said everyday problems are unlikely to indicate someone has ADHD.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The diagnosis as it is set out is so woolly that anything can potentially fit into it,' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But no, on its own not wanting to do dishes or other repetitive tasks is not ADHD it's completely normal, we

class=mol-para-with-font>Another potential source for the explosion in ADHD diagnoses is management apps, experts have suggested.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some are advertised online, like the
