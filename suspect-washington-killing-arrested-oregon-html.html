David Kalac, 33, surrendered to cops in Wilsonville, Oregon late on Wednesday night after a lengthy manhunt, during which he managed to elude authorities in a high-speed chase.
His arrest came hours after the body of his girlfriend, 30-year-old Amber Lynn Coplin, was found inside her Port Orchard, Washington home by her 13-year-old son and estranged husband."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The image board site soon grew to by much more, and quickly became one of the biggest websites in the world.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The biggest difference between 4chan and other websites however is that it allows commenters and contributors to post anonymously, giving many free reign to do things they would not do otherwise.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>While this has led to the site producing some amusing and funny pranks, many are horrific and have led to the arrest of the person or persons who created them.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:1.2em><span class=mol-style-bold>LOLCats</span> – The Internet obsession with cats actually began back in 2005 when one 4Chan commenter decided to post as a photo of a cat waiting for Caturday. It all took off from there.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Rickroll </span>– In 2007, a fake link to the trailer for the video game Grand Theft Auto IV was posted to the site after the website of the game’s publisher, Rockstar Games, crashed. Instead of seeing a look at the highly anticipated new game, eager fans were instead taken to the YouTube page for the Rick Astley music video 'Never Gonna Give You Up'.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Steve Jobs Death </span>– In 2008 members on the site spread a false rumor that Steve Jobs was dead, causing Apple stock prices to plummet a whopping 10% in one day.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Send Justin Bieber To North Korea</span>&nbsp;– Justin Bieber has long been a target for the site, and in 2010 he wanted fans to tell him where they wanted him to go on his My World Tour. 4Chan users hacked his site, and the overwhelming winner was North Korea. The Canadian did not ultimately make the trip.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Jessi Slaughter</span>&nbsp;– In what may have been their most vicious attack to date, members of 4Chan began to cyberbully an 11-year-old girl after claiming she was having a relationship with an older man. They posted her address, called her house, and spread false rumors and reports about her and her family. The threats got so bad that the young girl was put in police protection at one point.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Trayvon Martin</span> – In 2012 a 4Chan hacker and white supremacist falsely claimed they had hacked into Trayvon Martin’s email and Facebook accounts after his murder, posting emails and photos that were supposed to back up the false claim that Martin was a drug addict and dealer.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Cutting For Bieber</span> – In early 2013, a member of 4Chan created an elaborate Twitter hoax in which they urged fans of Justin Bieber to cut themselves so the pop star would stop smoking weed. Soon, the hashtags #cutforbieber and #cuttingforbieber amassed numerous photos of fans who claimed to have slashed their wrists and forearms over Bieber's drug use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Taylor Swift's Biggest Fan</span> – In 2013 Taylor Swift, like Bieber, wanted fans to help her out with her next contest. She was looking for her biggest fan, and 4Chan made sure the winner was a 39-year-old man named Charles who wanted to ‘sniff Taylor’s hair.’ The contest was ultimately cancelled.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Celebrity Nude Leaks</span> – Nothing 4Chan has done has had a bigger impact however than the leaking of hundreds of nude photos of celebrities in 2014, something that eventually led to the FBI getting involved. Victims included A-list stars like Jennifer Lawrence, Gabrielle Union, Kim Kardashian and Rihanna.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FeX6Sa3BrZ4OqwLGxwq1kkJmjnbavs9OopWajmaG5qrrGZpirqpWowaawjIipnp%2Bfo3upwMyl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
