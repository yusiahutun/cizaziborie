They obsess about symptoms they might have and worry they are suffering from severe illnesses and/or conditions.</p><p>It can become so obsessive it may become debilitating for the person suffering from health anxiety.</p><p>Peter said on the podcast: “Health anxiety is a thing, she has got an issue with that, I’d like Abs to worry less.
