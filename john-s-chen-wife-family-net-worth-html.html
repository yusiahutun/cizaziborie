In November 2014, during his interview with the Financial&nbsp;Times, John said that he had to tell Sherry to stop displaying her Samsung phone at the parties as it was embarrassing him. While they attended a couple of parties, his wife took out Samsung, and the guests humorously looked at him.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Though he talked with Sherry to use Blackberry, she embarrassed him by saying that she favors her Samsung.
