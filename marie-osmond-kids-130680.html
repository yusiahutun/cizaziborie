The “Paper Roses” singer has eight kids and she couldn’t love her big family anymore!</p><p>In 1983, Marie welcomed her first child, son Stephen Jr., with husband <a href=#><strong>Steve Craig</strong></a>. After the “A Little Bit Country, a Little Bit Rock ‘n’ Roll” songstress and her first spouse divorced in 1985, Marie tied the knot with <a href=#><strong>Brian Blosil</strong></a> in 1986. She later welcomed her kids, <a href=#>Rachael</a>, Matthew, <a href=#>Jessica</a>, Michael, Brandon, Brianna and Abigail, with Brian. Tragically, <a href=#>Michael died by suicide</a> at age 18 in February 2010.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with Closer Weekly, Marie revealed <a href=#>how music helped her grieve</a> after Michael’s tragic passing. “With my son, to get through that, I sang — and a lot of people judged me for going back to work so quickly,” she said in November 2016. “But I have seven other children who needed to keep living and that was how I processed my pain. Music is a powerful thing. When you stop loving music, you die. Music has always been there for me, through the highs and the lows.”</p><p>Michael’s death reinforced the importance of family to Marie. That’s why the Grammy nominee made sure to <a href=#>check in on her children</a> during the coronavirus pandemic. The performer — who <a href=#>later remarried her first husband, Steve</a>, in 2011 — stopped by Rachael and Jessica’s homes when she was <a href=#>on her way to Utah</a> in April 2020. Then, once she arrived home in St. George, Marie kept in contact with her family using a group chat.</p><p>“It’s one of those things where I know there are difficult times, and there are a lot of people going through trials. But for me, as a mother, it has been such a joy to see,” the <a href=#>Talk</a> alum said on an episode of the CBS series. “Because you wonder, when you leave this earth are your children going to stay close? Are they still going to still connect? And I know they will.”</p><p>For Marie, going out of the way for her kids is no problem at all considering motherhood means everything to her. “Out of all the awards and accolades that I have been blessed with throughout my life, nothing comes close in comparison with <a href=#>the blessings I receive</a> from being a mother to my eight children,” she gushed to Closer in another interview.</p><p><strong>To learn all about Marie’s big family, scroll through the gallery below for details on her eight kids!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmKuhlWK8tLnOp5tmo5mZwG59kmltcWhf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
