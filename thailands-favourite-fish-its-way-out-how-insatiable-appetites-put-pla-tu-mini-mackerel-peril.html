We used to walk into the sea with just a storm lantern filled with paraffin, and caught sea life just like that,” said the genial third-generation fisherman and president of Chonburi’s Coastal Fishing Association.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Large blue crabs, grouper and mullet were attracted to the light and could be scooped up by the handful, Amornsak recalls, as the hamlet of Ao Udom (which translates to Bay of Abundance) revelled in its reputation for fine and plentiful fish and seafood.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But that was then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/12/07/CLEAN-THUMB.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Now the sea, once beautiful with an unobstructed open view, has become an industrial base,” he said, explaining that large trawlers operating several kilometres offshore haul away most of the good catch, while “weekend fishers” closer to the coast vie with locals for the rest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Demand comes from everywhere for our fish, it’s domestic, it’s global … [and now] the balance is off, it’s out of control.”</p>Chonburi is a linchpin in Thailand’s much-hyped <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Eastern Economic Corridor</span></a>, a multibillion-dollar infrastructure scheme to transform the Southeast Asian nation into a logistics and aviation hub.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">New ports, refuelling points for shipping and companies ranging from EV giants to aircraft-parts makers have been joining the oil refineries, pipelines and factories that already populate much of the industrialised eastern seaboard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/08/c7c8361e-a1fb-4284-bf04-7b86bf2eda90_e16fdf8c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The province sits at the northern end of the horseshoe-shaped Gulf of Thailand, where pla tu traditionally spawn from October onwards at the end of a migratory cycle that brings them from the south to feast on the plentiful krill and baby shrimp.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pla tu’s life cycle starts near Chumpon on Thailand’s long, slender southern peninsula. From there they arc northwards, hugging the coast towards Mae Klong, as they mature into adults powered by nutrients pouring into the sea from major estuaries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Their favourite breeding ground is here in Chonburi,” Amornsak said. “After they have laid eggs in Chonburi, they’ll return to their original breeding ground and repeat the yearly cycle.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But this natural rhythm has been interrupted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The past five years have seen record low pla tu catches, hitting a nadir in 2018 with just 11,000 tonnes netted, according to official statistics from Thailand’s Fisheries Department.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year’s 32,000 tonnes was a little healthier, but still a far cry from the 136,000 tonnes caught in 2011 and 128,000 tonnes three years later. The longer term trend tracks a three-decade decline: in 1992, 96,000 tonnes of pla tu were caught.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To help stocks recover and allow the fish to mature before they face the fishermen’s nets, the Fisheries Department has instituted months-long fishing bans in the Gulf’s inner coastal areas. Yet the annual catch is still decreasing despite these efforts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This year, the fishing ban was imposed in the south between June and August and then along the coastal provinces further north between August and September to allow for spawning and the resulting larvae to feed and grow.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Smaller fish means they have to reproduce at a younger age … when that happens we know something is not rightJes Kettratad, marine scientist</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s too early to say if the expanded ban worked as no published data on its impact is yet available.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But fishermen say their empty nets suggest more disappointment is to come.</p>“How can we be the ‘<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">kitchen of the world</span></a>’ when we can’t even feed ourselves?” said Amornsak, citing a popular slogan the kingdom uses for its rice, sugar, fruit and seafood exports.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">A shrinking species</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Decades back, pla tu would reach first maturity – or reproductive age – when they hit 20cm-30cm in length. Over the years, that gradually dropped to 16cm.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And now, it is just 13cm, reflecting “a pretty scary” process of natural selection the fish have undergone to survive, according to marine scientist Jes Kettratad of Chulalongkorn University.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Smaller fish means they have to reproduce at a younger age … when that happens we know something is not right,” he said, adding that warmer sea temperatures and altered wind and rain patterns as a result of climate change had likely played a major role in rewiring the pla tu’s life cycle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is no way to tell for sure when the population may collapse, but if the current levels of decline continue Jes speculated that it could happen within two or three decades.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That bleak trajectory will have a calamitous impact on the hundreds of thousands of people currently employed in the pla tu industry, from fishers and fishmongers to the bamboo-basket makers, ubiquitous in Thai markets, who sell handmade receptacles for trios of ready-to-fry fish.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It does not bode well for the rest of the sea’s inhabitants, either.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Pla tu eats smaller fish and is eaten by bigger fish,” said Amornsak, the Chonburi fisherman. “They are in the middle of the food chain. If the pla tu supply is decreasing, other fish that feed on them like giant queenfish or grouper … will follow suit because they have no food.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the shortbodied mackerel population depleted, Thai fishers have had to look further and further down the food chain for new sources of protein.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/08/e8a573ff-de9c-469f-8a15-f8416f5d7642_8ac06bf0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They’re hoovering up this incredibly important species before it’s the right size, or has achieved its full value,” said Dominic Thomson, Southeast Asia regional director of the Bangkok-based Environmental Justice Foundation. “It’s a race to the bottom.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With more than 8,000 commercial vessels in the Gulf, the EJF says that bottom trawlers are responsible for indiscriminately scooping up fish, including juveniles too small for the main market, which are instead bundled up as cheap ‘trash fish’ to be used in pet food and animal feed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pausing fishing is not an option, however, in a kingdom where fisheries employ more than 2 million people, contribute US$3.45 billion a year to gross domestic product and account for 8 per cent of all exports, according to government data.</p>The sector is also seeking to move beyond its recent painful history after being hit by a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">slavery-at-sea scandal</span></a> in 2015 and identified by the European Union as an overfishing hotspot. That triggered a “root and branch” clean up of the fishing industry, which saw the-then junta government step up the registration of crews and tracing of catches made by Thai-flagged boats.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/08/b6c15535-3c08-49ea-b24a-e19324017e05_fb4f1e1c.jpg>In response to these actions, Thailand’s fishing industry was later <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">removed from the EU’s watch list</span></a>, averting an import ban that would have cost it hundreds of millions of euros a year.
