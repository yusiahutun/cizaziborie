If you are planning to buy a weave or hair extension, there are several things that you need to do to maintain its look, especially if you are planning to reuse it. It is only by properly washing and taking care of a weave that you can extend its lifetime to several months. Here is a step by step procedure on how to clean a weave before you install it on your head.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a2658e9d2dd3f342.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to take care of Brazilian weave</span></p></a><h2>How to wash weave for reuse</h2><p class=align-left>The following are the steps that you need to follow when you are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cleaning the weave </a>to reuse it.</p><h3>Step 1: Detangling the weave before washing</h3><p class=align-left>Before you begin washing the weave, you need to begin by detangling it. Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle the weave to prevent breakage. You can add some conditioner and water to the weave before you detangle it. When detangling, you need to begin from the ends and work your way up to the roots. It's advisable to use your fingers to loosen any knots that you come across when detangling the weave.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: How to prevent scalp burn from relaxer</p><h3>Step 2: Deep conditioning the weave</h3><p class=align-left>Now that the weave is free from tangles, you can proceed to deep condition it. This is a very important step in bringing back the weave to life. Conditioning the weave plays an important role in loosening the hair cuticles, and it leaves the weave soft. When applying the conditioner, you need to ensure that it saturates each strand. After you have applied the conditioner, use a wide-tooth comb to comb through the weave to ensure even distribution.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/640cb6baff7a2eca.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>3C hair: Texture, styling, care routine, moisturing, products</span></p></a><h3>Step 3: Shampooing the weave</h3><p class=align-left>After applying the deep conditioner, you should proceed to wash the weave or shampoo it before installing it on your head. Use a mild shampoo and lukewarm water when shampooing the weave. Choose a shampoo that is specifically designed for dry hair because it will intensely nourish and moisturize the weave.</p><p class=align-left>It is recommended that you should not scrub or rub the shampoo on the weave. You should place the extensions into the lukewarm water and leave them to soak for about 10 minutes. Avoid any form of friction that can damage the weave. After washing the weave, remove it from the water and rinse it under a running tap. You should let the water run through the weave to rinse away the shampoo. Once you are done with this step, you should squeeze out any excess water from the weave.</p><h3>Step 4: Leave-in treatment for the weave</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5557399f880194ca.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Effective ways on how to remove dreadlocks buildup</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After shampooing the weave, you need to gently apply a leave-in treatment through the hair extension using your fingers. After applying the leave-in treatment, fold the weave into a clean towel and leave it for about one hour before rinsing the product. You should never make the mistake of applying oils to the weave because they create mats and tangles.</p><h3>Step 5: Drying the weave</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a2658e9d2dd3f342.jpg><p class=align-left>After you are done with this process, you should leave the weave to air dry. You should not use any form of heat when drying the weave. If you want to blow-dry the weave, ensure that the heat is low. Ensure that the weave is properly dried before you install it on your head. If you install the weave when it is still wet, it runs the risk of acquiring tangles.</p><h2>How to wash a curly weave</h2><p class=align-left>A curly weave demands <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">more attention </a>when compared to the normal weave.
