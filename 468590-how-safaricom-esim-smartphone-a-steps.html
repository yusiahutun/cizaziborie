So, what are the steps for getting a Safaricom e-SIM for your smartphone?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2f4b21485ef50fff.jpeg><p class=align-left>The steps have always been the same. You get a physical SIM card from your preferred network provider if you need to communicate. Fortunately, with technological advancements, you are not obliged to do so. The e-SIM functions like a normal SIM card but is embedded in your phone instead of being physically installed.</p><p class=align-left>And you guessed it, Safaricom has it, and they have been installing it on clients' phones for some time now. So, what are the steps for getting an eSIM from Safaricom?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/15704375cd8b925f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bolt Food courier registration: requirements, salary, contacts</span></p></a><h2>What is an eSIM?</h2><p class=align-left>There are billions of SIM cards in the <a href=#>world</a>, much more than people on the planet. In 2016, the International Card Manufacturers Association (ICMA) mentioned that there were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">around 5.4 billion </a>SIM cards. Of course, the number of subscribers has increased over the years resulting in more SIM cards. However, they are not necessarily physical anymore.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> <i>check out news exactly <strong>for YOU</strong> ➡️ find "Recommended for you" block and enjoy!</i></p><p class=align-left>The eSIM technology is one of the most phenomenal, considering its flexibility. An eSIM, loosely translated to embedded SIM, is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">small chip</a> inside your phone, working the same way as your NFC chip used for payments like Google Pay and Apple Pay.</p><p class=align-left>The eSIM technology is so interesting because the information on your eSIM is rewritable. What does this mean? You can switch between operators instantly, either with a simple phone call or by swapping <a href=#>phone numbers</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b4608ab057127387.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to activate M-Pesa till number for your business</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The eSIM technology is supported by the GSMA, the association of mobile networks that have defined the standards for eSIM worldwide.</p><h2>How do eSIMs work?</h2><p class=align-left>With an eSIM-compatible device, you can install an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">eSIM profile</a> provided by your carrier. You can also purchase an eSIM data plan on the go if possible. On top of this, you can utilize numerous operators simultaneously on the same device based on your preference.</p><h2>How to get the Safaricom eSIM</h2><p class=align-left>First things first, “Does Safaricom support eSIM?” The company has been supporting eSIM technology since 2021. They made a low-key announcement about it in 2021 and even shared it on their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">official Twitter handle</a> in a January post of the same year. This inclusion makes them the second telecommunications firm in Kenya to support eSIM after Jamii Telkom’s <a href=#>Faiba</a>.</p><p class=align-left>So, if you have already verified that your phone is eSIM compatible, you must visit any Safaricom Shop to purchase the eSIM. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">virtual SIM card</a> costs Ksh.150 when swapping from a physical SIM and Ksh.250 for an eSIM with a new <a href=#>phone number</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fe4714a3db994859.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get M-Pesa Till statement</span></p></a><h2>Activation of your eSIM</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/15704375cd8b925f.png><p class=align-left>Once you request an eSIM from Safaricom, they will verify whether your phone is indeed compatible and issue you with one if it complies. While at the Safaricom Shop with your supported device, the attendant will issue you a unique QR code that you will scan with your smartphone.</p><p class=align-left>Once scanned, your smartphone will download the required data and install all eSIM settings on your phone. After it completes the installation, your eSIM is ready. But, first, you will have to do a Safaricom eSIM registration just like you do for a physical SIM card.</p><h2>Does my phone support an eSIM?</h2><p class=align-left>Before applying for an eSIM, you must know whether your device supports the technology. And you can do this by going to your device's network setting and searching for this option.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, if you use an Android device version, you will find the option in the network settings. Once there, click the plus button to connect to a mobile network.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b4a58543a46e7fe.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to use Safaricom Zuri telegram bot</span></p></a><p class=align-left>At the bottom of the screen, you will notice an option stating, “Download a SIM instead?”. Click it and follow the prompts to add your eSIM details as provided by your telecommunications company.</p><h2>What documents do you need to acquire an eSIM?</h2><p class=align-left>When registering a new line for your eSIM, you must provide the necessary documents for <a href=#>line registration</a>, including your national identification documents. In other instances, you will only need your original identification documents, such as ID and passport.</p><h2>Can you apply for an eSIM online?</h2><p class=align-left>Now, all Safaricom eSIM applications are done at Safaricom Shops. Therefore, you cannot call the Safaricom Call Centre or access any online portal to activate services on your eSIM.</p><h2>What are the advantages of an eSIM?</h2><p class=align-left>The embedded Safaricom SIM card comes with numerous advantages that include the following:</p><ul><li>It is easier to switch networks.</li><li>One can temporarily change to another network.</li><li>It enables one to have more than one SIM card.</li><li>Utilizes less physical space on your phone.</li><li>You cannot lose your eSIM as it is built onto your phone’s motherboard.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/57e139442139fb14.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to reverse a PesaPal transaction</span></p></a><p class=align-left>All you need to do to enjoy the advantages of the Safaricom eSIM is to visit your nearest Safaricom Shop with your compatible gadget and install it.
