So, what cars like Jeep Wrangler do you know about?</p><h2>10 cars that look like jeeps that afford you a suitable alternative</h2><p class=align-left>What does Jeep offer that makes it so classy and in high demand? As with most cars, it is just what the buyer is looking for, and for the Jeep, the driver gets comfort, sturdiness, off-road usability, and impressive design.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ca27b44f69ce3aa3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Viral Safari Rally Dad Says He Bought Famous Vehicle for KSh 70k: “Can’t Sell It”</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What if you went for another cheap or expensive car that looks like a Jeep? You might be surprised that so many vehicles are similar to the Jeep in design and amenities. Which ones are the best in the market?</p><h3>1. Nissan Xterra</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ca27b44f69ce3aa3.jpg><p class=align-left>The Nissan Xterra is your perfect response to "What cars look similar to a Jeep?” People in the market for an off-road automobile and don’t want to go for the Jeep usually settle for this excellent model. The Nissan Xterra is strikingly similar to the Jeep in appearance and functionality. However, the cars have a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">slight difference</a> in terms of horsepower.</p><p class=align-left>The Nissan Xterra has a 4.0L V6 engine that produces 261 horsepower. The Jeep has a 3.6L V6 engine and delivers 285 horsepower; therefore, it is stronger than the Nissan Xterra, but by a small margin.</p><h3>2. Suzuki Jimmy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/22840d3a3f8d2d7c.jpeg><p class=align-left>Among cars that look like jeeps but aren't is the Suzuki Jimmy. This brand is quite similar to the Jeep in numerous aspects. It is a descendant of the original Suzuki 4x4, the 1970s LJ10. Like the Jeep, Suzuki Jimmy is a perfect offroad automobile with a box body shape.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6b46d8d30d8b218e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Seeking an 'angel': African startups face funding challenge</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The car model has a separate frame and body. The Suzuki Jimmy utilises a 1.5L four-cylinder engine that produces up to <a href=#>100 horsepower</a>.</p><h3>3. Ford Bronco</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/905ffe267e10c823.jpeg><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ford Bronco’s incredible design</a> isn’t the only thing that attracts people; its impressive performance matches the Jeep and is something to remember the next time you are looking for a Jeep alternative.</p><p class=align-left>The car is comfortable and driver-friendly on the road, and it even has a more significant advantage over Jeep for off-road enthusiasts. The Ford Bronco has a narrow body and a short wheelbase.</p><h3>4. Toyota 4Runner</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6b46d8d30d8b218e.jpg><p class=align-left>Although Toyota 4Runner isn't a new vehicle that looks like a jeep, it has been in the market long enough to gain a good following from car enthusiasts who have found it impressive.</p><p class=align-left>The Toyota 4Runner is more significant than the Jeep. The Jeep Wrangler is 184.9 inches long, 73.7 inches wide, and 72.6 inches high, while the Toyota 4Runner is 191.3 inches long, 75.8 inches wide and 71.5 inches high.

A first look would have you dismiss it as among the types of Jeeps you don't know much about.</p><p class=align-left>The Suzuki Samurai is a four-wheel drive, which means its engine sends sufficient power to the front and wheel axles. It also comes with a factory bulbar (not attractive) that provides the desired protection against damage in a collision.</p><h3>8. Toyota FJ Cruiser</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1e13011f54e3a0cf.jpeg><p class=align-left>Undoubtedly, Toyota made the Toyota FJ Cruiser to compete with the Jeep Wrangler considering the striking similarity.
