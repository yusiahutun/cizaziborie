"And then I was like 'Hold on, wait a minute.'"</p><p>In her new memoir <strong>"Love, Loss and What We Ate,"</strong> the <strong>"Top Chef"</strong> host reveals that she "didn't know the paternity myself, until that September."</p><p>Lakshmi was dating both IMG CEO <strong>Teddy Forstmann</strong> and <strong>Adam Dell</strong>, the brother of Dell Computer founder <strong>Michael Dell</strong>, at the time.

"Maybe he didn't know if he could stay in a romantic relationship with me or not. I think neither of us knew what was going to happen but he was resolute in making sure I wasn't alone. He held my hand and he held it very publicly."</p><p>Forstmann died from brain cancer back in 2011.</p><p>Padma decided to dedicate her memoir to him. She says the way he stood by her, "was a great example of Teddy's character."</p><p>To hear more about her book, check out her interview with <strong><a href=#>PEOPLE.</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnd7j2xmaXBfpa6lucBmo5qjo526qnnTqKdmm5ias26wwK6eoayVp3qnrdOhnKtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
