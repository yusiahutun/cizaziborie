Red helps the lips appear fuller and more youthful and creates a focal point, drawing attention away from other signs of aging, such as fine lines or wrinkles,” explains <a href=# rel=noopener>Dyana Aives</a>, celebrity makeup artist for beauty on-demand service <a href=# rel=noopener>Ring My Belle</a>, who has worked with Melissa Etheridge and Amy Schumer. “It can also be a powerful tool to enhance self-esteem and showcase a strong and vibrant presence. Red lipstick is a timeless and classic choice transcending age.” And wearing a red lip will transform the most casual style into a sophisticated and luxe look — as long as you find the best red lipstick for your skin tone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to determine your skin tone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/red-lip.jpg><p>There are <a href=# rel=noopener>hundreds of crimson hues</a> to choose from — some can be more pinkish, while some have purplish blue undertones. Still others can border on coral, and of course, there’s the most vibrant, fire-engine red, that not everyone can pull off. But how do you select the right one for you? Determining your skin tone is the foundation for choosing the right shade of red. Aives says there are five primary skin tones to consider.&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>1. <strong>Fair skin tone</strong>: This refers to individuals with lighter skin who tend to burn or freckle in the sun. Fair skin tones often have pink or peach undertones.&nbsp; (Click here for more on determining your <a href=# rel=noopener>skin undertones</a>.)</p><p>2. <strong>Light skin tone:</strong> This is slightly darker than fair skin but still falls on the lighter end of the spectrum. Light skin tones can have a range of undertones, including pink, peach or olive (if you’re bordering on medium or tend to be more medium after being out in the sun).&nbsp;</p><p>3. <strong>Medium skin tone:</strong> They usually have a balance of warm and cool undertones and a mix of yellow and pink undertones.&nbsp;</p><p>4. <strong>Tan skin tone:</strong> Tan skin tones are characterized by a warm, golden or olive undertone. They typically have a deeper complexion with a sun-kissed glow.&nbsp;</p><p>5. <strong>Deep skin tone:</strong> Deep skin tones have rich, dark complexions with deeper undertones. These undertones, such as deep brown, ebony or even mahogany, can range from warm to cool.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The best red lipstick for every skin tone</h2><p>Now that you know how to determine your tone, it’s time to pick some red lipsticks that’ll stand out! Simply choose the complementary shade (or shades) of red that corresponds with your skin tone.</p><p>Red lipsticks are typically made in shades with three undertones: blue, yellow/orange and pink.&nbsp;“Fair-skinned and light-skinned women with a neutral or cool undertone look great in cool reds with a blue base,” says makeup pro <a href=# rel=noopener>Genn Shaughnessy</a>, who has worked with Carrie Underwood and Judy Greer&nbsp;</p><p>Since medium skin tones can be a mixture of warm and cool, they should look for “warmer shades of red with gold and yellow in them which complement warm and neutral medium undertones … but if on the cooler side, find ones with a more blue base. Darker skin tones can wear warm or cool reds and look gorgeous in berry and wine colors,” she explains.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Best red lipstick for fair & light skin tones</h3><p>If you have a fair or light skin tone like Nicole Kidman, Shaughnessy advises looking for cool red with a blue base.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/GettyImages-1357593712.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Screenshot-2023-12-18-at-12.37.06-PM.png><p><strong>Meloway Makeup’s Hi-Rise Matte Lipstick in “Sleeping Beauty”</strong> (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Buy from Meloway, $25</a>)</p><p>Fair skin tones can opt for this red lipstick, which hydrates dry and chapped lips with plumping peptides.

If your medium skin is warmer, opt for rich reds with yellow and gold. If it’s on the cooler side, look for blue undertones like the recommendations for fair skin. Depending on your mood, you can go with either if you’re more neutral!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/mac_sku_MCF315_1x1_0.jpeg><p><strong>MAC Creamsheen in “Brave Red”</strong> (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from MAC, $23</a>)</p><p>This red shade is Aives’s choice for medium skin tones because of its bright, yellow undertones.

But you don’t have to be a makeup pro to get it right. We tapped <a href=# rel=noopener>Saffron Hughes</a>, resident makeup artist for <a href=# rel=noopener>FalseEyelashes.co.uk</a>, to share her professional application tips to ensure a flawless look. Her 5 easy steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Scrub. </strong>Begin with a lip scrub to give the lipstick something to stick to. After this, use a lip primer and spread it evenly before waiting five minutes to allow it to seep into the skin.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Line lips</strong>. This not only defines the shape of your lips but extends the longevity of your red lip and can make your lips look fuller. To line your lips, mark an X on your cupid’s bow before joining it with your natural lips in the outer corners. Next, line your bottom lip, beginning in the center, before slowly working your way out by tracing over the natural edges of your lips.&nbsp;</p><p>Or watch this TikTok from user <a href=# rel=noopener>@smithadepak</a> that shows how to line thin lips so they appear fuller:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@smithadepak href=#>@smithadepak</a><p>Try this simple hack by changing your lip liner to achieve bigger, jucier lips with makeup, that look natural, heart shaped!!

Using a flat lip brush, apply the red lipstick carefully over the initial pencil layer before filling in the rest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 4: Spot treat.</strong> To fine-tune your lip shape or fix any lip color mishaps, finish by going around your lips with concealer.<strong> </strong>Not only will this color correct any slip-ups during application, it will make your lips appear clean and crisp throughout the day.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Finish</strong>. A touch of translucent powder is the secret to a velvety matte look. But for those craving a hint of shine, dab of gloss on the bottom lip to deliver just the right amount of allure.</p><p>First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.
