However, with his new album 'Night Train' set to hit stores in one week (Oct. 16), the singer had many interviews and publicity commitments to honor.</p><p>"You can handle it two ways. You can go hide and run from it, or you can get up and face it and deal with it," Aldean says in the video below, adding, "and that's kind of what we tried to do and just kind of move on."</p><p>"I know everybody's kinda going to have their opinion, and for the people that know me and know what I'm about... the people that are standing by us and supporting us, all I've got to say to them is thanks," he said. "I mean, I really appreciate it, and it's just been a really unfortunate thing. Really embarrassing, I think, more than anything."</p><p>'Take a Little Ride' is currently sitting at No. 1 on the Billboard country charts for a third street week. 'Night Train' is Aldean's fifth studio album.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: See the Most Shocking Moments in Country History</a><p><strong>&nbsp;Watch Jason Aldean Talk About His Recent Tabloid Scandal</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mjpLturcudnJqmXZi1pq3ToqWgZaOYrq%2BwwKVkn5mdnrm6ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
