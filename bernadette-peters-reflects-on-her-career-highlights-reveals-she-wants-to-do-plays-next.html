She says she’d still love to work with actors like <a href=#><strong>Robert DeNiro</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Al Pacino</strong></a> because they’re the “great” ones. However, if you ask Bernadette what the highlight of her career is, she’ll struggle to give you an answer.</p><p>“You know, I have to say I’ve been so fortunate and I’ve had so many high points and so many great projects like all the [<strong>Stephen Sondheim</strong>] ones, <strong>Jerry Herman</strong>, that came full circle because I started the Mack & Mabel and I just did Hello, Dolly!, and what a fabulous show that is,” she recalls. “I had no idea until I worked on it what a beautifully constructed show [it is].”</p><p>“I’m really fortunate that I’ve lived at this time when Steve was doing all those shows,” the Grammy Award winning star added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shutterstock_editorial_10468750am.jpg><p>The next time you see&nbsp;Bernadette, she’ll probably be impressing you with her new TV series Animaniacs that’s scheduled to come out later this year.
