A refugee invented butter chicken, and changed the face of Indian cuisine
“Originally named samsa, after the pyramids in Central Asia, historical accounts also refer to the delicacy as sanbusak, sanbusaq or even sanbusaj, all deriving from the Persian word sanbosag,” says food historian Ajay Shukla."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Delhi Sultanate was an Islamic empire that stretched over the Indian subcontinent for more than 300 years.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">A refugee invented butter chicken, and changed the face of Indian cuisine</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Originally named samsa, after the pyramids in Central Asia, historical accounts also refer to the delicacy as sanbusak, sanbusaq or even sanbusaj, all deriving from the Persian word sanbosag,” says food historian Ajay Shukla.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the Middle East, says Shukla, the semicircular version of the samosa is stuffed with cheese, onions, herbs, spices and minced meat. “In Israel, samosas have a chickpeas and pine nuts filling, while Portugal and Brazil are famous for their meaty chamuças and pasteis. Across Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, you’ll find Uygur-style samosas with a heavier bread dough and a lamb centre,” he explains.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">The true hallmark of a delicious samosa is its pastry. It should be crispy, not too thick nor too thin and a burnished brown in colourRitesh Negi, executive chef of the Radisson Blu MBD Hotel Noida</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The samosa also finds mention in literature. Persian scholar Abul-Fazl Bayhaqi refers to samosas in his records in 11th century as a “dainty delicacy, served as a snack in the great courts of the mighty Ghaznavid empire. The fine pastry was filled with minced meats, nuts and dried fruit and then fried till the pastry was crisp”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Samosas quickly became a prized dish among Indian royalty. Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta mentions their presence at Mughal emperor Muhammad bin Tughlaq’s banquets in 14th century Delhi. “They were made of minced meat cooked with almonds, pistachios, onions and spices placed inside a thin envelope of wheat and deep-fried in ghee,” he noted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The snack’s inclusion in the Ain-I-Akbari, a 16th century document written by Mughal emperor Akbar’s court historian, Abul-Fazl, gave the dish a royal imprimatur. Fazl declared that among dishes cooked with wheat, there is the qutab, “which the people of Hind called the sanbusa”. Upon their arrival in India in the 17th century, the British became so enamoured with the samosa that they took it to all corners of their colonial empire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/22/ccf14160-5adf-11eb-a99a-beae699a1a1d_972x_105316.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The true hallmark of a delicious samosa is its pastry,” explains Ritesh Negi, executive chef of the Radisson Blu MBD Hotel Noida in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. “It should be crispy, not too thick nor too thin and a burnished brown in colour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The oil’s temperature should be between 160-180 degrees Celsius [320-360 degrees Fahrenheit], though this also depends on the samosa’s size and how many are being fried in one go in the wok,” he says.</p>Negi says a samosa is the perfect comfort food because it is tasty, cheap and versatile. “It can be enjoyed in a sandwich, inside a bun like a burger or as a chaat with lashings of cool curds, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">chutneys</span></a> and a sprinkling of dried yellow chillies, cumin powder and chilli flakes. Wash it all down with hot ginger tea, and it is a marriage made in heaven,” he says.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/22/20e10f1a-5ae2-11eb-a99a-beae699a1a1d_972x_105316.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Samosas come in more varieties than than the vegetarian, chicken and lamb options typically found at Indian restaurants outside India. Various places in the country have come up with their own samosa variants – and there can be fierce debate over which one is the best.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the southern city of Hyderabad, for instance, a samosa is called lukmi. Flat and square, and stuffed with kheema (minced mutton), it is a favourite delicacy during the holy month of Ramadan. In northern Punjab, a samosa is stuffed with potatoes, cinnamon, peppercorns, cloves, green cardamom, cumin, and fennel, coriander and dried pomegranate seeds.</p>Cauliflower samosa, or phulkopir singara, reigns supreme in West Bengal, served with a side of ketchup. Onion samosa rules in the desert state of Rajasthan. Some experimental cooks have even given the samosa a sweet spin, filling it with a mixture of khoya (<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">evaporated milk</span></a>), sugar, desiccated coconut, dried fruits and nuts. Jam samosas are popular with students.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why cinnamon is good for you and could help prevent diabetes</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then there are samosas filled with noodles, cheese, pasta, lentils, chickpeas, chocolate, mushrooms, fish, chicken and corn. Their size also varies – from a monstrous six-incher (15cm long) to the bite-sized “nano” samosa served as a canapé at weddings and parties.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Samosa’s accompaniments are equally diverse, ranging from the classic choley (chickpeas) sabzi (an Indian term for a vegetable dish) to methi ki launji, or fenugreek seeds pickle. Some cooks pair it with a tomato and potato curry garnished with freshly chopped coriander leaves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We take pride in serving the country’s largest samosa,” says master chef Rahul Sood of The Embassy restaurant in New Delhi. In business since 1948, it serves a samosa three times the size of the standard ones. It is, as Sood puts it, “not a snack but a whole meal”. The restaurant also serves samosa burgers, as well as deconstructed samosas with a cottage cheese filling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/22/2003adaa-5ae2-11eb-a99a-beae699a1a1d_972x_105316.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such has been the dish’s popularity that three years ago, the restaurant launched a tuck shop just outside its doors just to sell samosas, where long queues can form. “We’ve come from Meerut [a city 150km or 93 miles from Delhi] to enjoy the samosas here,” says Rohit Agarwal, 36, a businessman and a regular. “They are simply irresistible.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Modern takes on the snack are also in vogue. In 2016, husband and wife team of Shikhar Veer Singh and Nidhi Singh quit their jobs and sold their flat in the southern city of Bangalore to launch WoknStove Foodworks, a start-up that sells samosas under the brand name Samosa Singh.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The chain, which operates in southern Bangalore and Hyderabad, sells more than 50 types of samosas as well as a samosa chaat and various combos. In a nod to China, they make “samosa Szechwan” and “Chinese Samosa”, filled with fiery noodles and meats.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The delights of dosa, a savoury pancake that’s made for breakfast</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company raised US$2.7 million in funding last year, scaling up operations and expanding into new cities even as the pandemic ravaged food businesses. This year, it plans to cater to individual households through its cloud kitchen model.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not all samosa innovations are a hit. Last year, when then US president Donald Trump visited India, the broccoli and corn ones served to him at a state banquet got unsavoury reviews. One Twitter user reacting to the dish wrote, “Broccoli samosas?”, with a puking emoticon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/22/0a6af8dc-5ae1-11eb-a99a-beae699a1a1d_972x_105316.jpg><h3 type=h2 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Samosas in space</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Usually, when chefs mention taking a dish to the “next level”, the reference is to elevating its taste. However, restaurateur Niraj Gadher took things quite literally by attempting to send the savoury, triangle-shaped Indian samosa into space.</p>Last week, the young chef, who owns Chaiwalla, an Indian restaurant in Bath in Britain, attached a packet of home-made <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">samosas</span></a> to two helium balloons and released them into the air as a joke, saying: “We could all use a laugh in these bleak times”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To record the deep-fried pastries’ journey, the packet was fitted with a GoPro camera and a GPS tracker. However, a technical glitch caused it to crash-land in northern France the next day. Gadher messaged people in the area over Instagram to see if anyone could hunt down the snacks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A follower discovered the remains of the balloon in a field in Picardy. Unfortunately, the samosas were missing from the crash site, leading Gadher to joke they “may have been consumed by French wildlife”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The mystery of the missing samosas is still unresolved, but Gadher and his restaurant have tasted instant fame. They trended on social media and “the feedback is that it has triggered a lot of laughs and that’s what we wanted really, to spread joy”, says the chef.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9ofnKEk3FpaJ2Xrr21v4ygoJ%2BsXZ67pbXAZqqapZ%2Borm68zqmspZmiYrOztcSdZKmZo6m%2FunnSp5ico12jrq6xww%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
