When ordering or making this all-American classic, it's always a good idea to buy or make extra so there are leftovers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><strong>To be honest, a piece of cold fried chicken, right out of the fridge, makes a great late night snack or lunch and can be a total pleasure all by itself. </strong>(It's also a great <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g783/picnic-recipes-0609/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="picnic food" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">picnic food</a>.) But sometimes you've got enough for a whole new dinner, and you'd rather eat it warm. So is it possible to reheat fried chicken, you ask? It is! And luckily, reheating fried chicken is pretty simple and straightforward. Here's what you need to know.</p><h2 title="Is it safe to reheat fried chicken?" data-anchor-id=is-it-safe-to-reheat-fried-chicken class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 eqwrocx1">Is it safe to reheat fried chicken?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">In short, yes. Reheating leftover fried chicken is safe, provided that it was fully cooked the first time and was well wrapped and refrigerated promptly (within a couple hours) after it was originally cooked. In fact, eating leftover fried chicken cold or even room temperature is safe as long as it hasn't spent more than two hours in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/danger-zone-40-f-140-f/CT_Index data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='the "danger zone,"' class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">the "danger zone,"</a> which is the USDA's term for temperatures between 40°F and 140°F, when bacteria grow fastest.</p><h2 title="How do you keep reheated fried chicken crispy?" data-anchor-id=how-do-you-keep-reheated-fried-chicken-crispy class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 eqwrocx1">How do you keep reheated fried chicken crispy?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The trick to reheating any kind of meat is to keep the moisture levels in balance. Some methods—such as the microwave, which works by heating up the water in a food—will keep meat moist, but make it unpleasantly soft. Other methods, such as the oven, can dry meat out if you're not careful, making it tough and chewy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">There's no reheating method that can get leftover fried chicken to taste as good as it does when it's freshly cooked, but it's not terribly difficult to get something close to a return to glory as long as you're careful. Here's what we suggest. (Note: this method should work well with other fried foods as well.)</p><img alt="cornflake crusted baked chicken with pickles" title="cornflake crusted baked chicken" width=2400 height=3145 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cornflake-crusted-baked-chicken-1589392273.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h2 title="The best way to reheat fried chicken is in an oven." data-anchor-id=the-best-way-to-reheat-fried-chicken-is-in-an-oven class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 eqwrocx1">The best way to reheat fried chicken is in an oven.</h2><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-1weux9v et3p2gv0">1.
