She has not offered any information about her parents and siblings. She had a keen interest in horse training while growing up.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/275022bcce38c30b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cecily Strong: Net worth, boyfriend, height, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Even though she would have loved to be a veterinarian, her <a href=#>science</a> grades were not good enough to allow her to pursue a course in vet school. As a result, she opted to focus on horse riding. As a child, the journalist used to cut pictures from different racetracks in newspapers and magazines and stick them on her wall.</p><p class=align-left>Her father promised her half the money needed to buy a horse on condition she came up with the other half. She managed to save her share of the money with great determination, and her father topped up the rest as agreed upon.</p><p class=align-left>She did not own saddles and thus rode bareback for months. This came in handy as it made her a natural rider. It was easy for her to compete in the challenging <a href=#>sport</a> of polo and rodeo.</p><h3>Education</h3><p class=align-left>Ursula has not offered any information about her elementary and high school <a href=#>education</a>. However, she joined Louisiana State University's Manship School of Journalism. She graduated in 1983 with a Bachelor's Degree in Broadcast Journalism.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/08e5b107b0884144.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kelly Stables: Height, measurements, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Before getting lured into broadcast journalism, she wanted to become a graphic artist. She had enrolled for a Degree in Graphic Designs from Louisiana State University.</p><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>The journalist did not become a great media personality in a day. She has grown steadily over the years and risen over the ranks from a college student reporter to the great KSAT anchor she is today. Here is the breakdown of her career highlights:</p><h4>Early career</h4><p class=align-left>The journalist began her career in the media industry while still in college. She was a news reporter for a college's radio station. She started working at KLFYTV10 in Lafayette immediately after her graduation. She worked as a reporter for:</p><ul><li>Louisiana Legislature</li><li>Hurricanes</li><li>The Nutria Pelt Business</li></ul><p class=align-left>The beginning of her career was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a tough period </a>as she had to engage in numerous activities independently.</p>I was completely thrown into the water and expected to swim. I not only had to come up with stories by travelling daily three parishes in my beat, but I also had to edit them by myself in time for the 5 pm news.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dde352cde91a828c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rhea Hughes bio: Husband, divorce, salary, brother, home, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She typewrote 6 copies using a carbon paper sheet known as the set sheets as it was the only available thing during her time. A slight error meant repeating the entire process, and thus, she learnt to be keen at her work from early on.</p><h4>Journalism career</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/275022bcce38c30b.jpg><p class=align-left>Her indulgence into the journalism sector was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a mere accident</a> as opposed to what many people would think. While in college, her professors constantly pushed her towards communications and news-related classes even though she was largely inclined to being an artist.</p><p class=align-left>However, Pari discovered that she had a lot of energy in gathering stories and putting news together. She always wanted to be the first person to know what's happening and all the tiny details and bits about it.</p><p class=align-left>As her journalism career progressed, she relocated to Portland, Maine. She sought permission from her manager to travel to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other research locations in New England. She aimed at putting together a series of news and stories regarding the upcoming dynamics in the technology sector.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c7c82395152be725.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dr Dee Alaska Vet: Husband, family, net worth, career, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The entire daring experience was not only challenging but also mind-blowing.</p>This was back in the early 1990s, and the stories were mind-blowing to me. Trying to explain how virtual reality was being incubated into something that would one day be used in television shows was difficult.<h4>KSAT News career</h4><p class=align-left>Just like her career in the journalism sector, the entrance into KSAT News was equally an accident. She arrived at the station at around 1 pm and was told to fill in for a pregnant co-worker under labour induction.</p>I almost didn’t have time to get nervous. I showed up at 1 pm and was told I would immediately be needed to fill in for a pregnant co-worker who was being induced to have her baby.<p class=align-left>Just like that, she started her career at KSAT, anchoring at 5 pm <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><i>News </i>and<i> Nightbeat</i></a>. She was more of a natural in the sector, as revealed in the overnight ratings. The News and Nightbeat shows were both given a win rating.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/153fbaffdec35470.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Miranda Lambert: husband, net worth, siblings, kids, songs</span></p></a><h4>Accident and work come-back</h4><p class=align-left>The journalist is known as a huge lover of horses and horse riding. Even with more than 45 years of experience as a horse-rider, she faced a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">life-changing accident.</a> On 2nd June 2019, as her horse was racing on the way to goal, she reached too far for a ball that she ended up losing her grip on the saddle.</p>I knew there was no getting back in place and was sideways on the horse, so I kicked my feet out of the stirrups and bailed off.<p class=align-left>The accident was so severe since she was riding so fast and bailed out so hard. She suffered the following injuries:</p><ul><li>Crushed ribcage</li><li>Punctured right lung</li><li>Broken collarbone</li><li>Broken thumb</li></ul><p class=align-left>The journalist was taken to the BAMC Trauma Unit, where she was kept in the intensive care unit. One day later, the surgeons opened her chest and fixed the broken ribs by adding metal plates for proper amendment.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5e44049a92e0e36c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Destiny Etiko biography: Husband, children, parents, net worth, house, movies</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She stayed in the hospital for 10 days before being sent to recover at home, where she stayed for two months. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">returned to work</a> in August 2019, and this is what she had to say.</p>Many thanks for all the flowers, gifts, amazing notes and messages of encouragement, emails, and calls to check up on me. I’ll return to KSAT with a new appreciation for health, oxygen and fitness.<h3>Ursula Pari's husband and children</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/08e5b107b0884144.jpg><p class=align-left>The journalist has been married twice and divorced once.
