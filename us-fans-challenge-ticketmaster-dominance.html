The FFC initiated its `The Monopoly` campaign six weeks ago, aiming to empower live event enthusiasts to advocate for fairer ticketing practices.
Led by a bipartisan team of antitrust experts, this non-profit entity was established to raise awareness and provide fans with a platform to voice their concerns."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Monopoly is giving a voice to fans across the country, and the FFC is providing a platform to ensure those voices are heard – no fee required. I look forward to seeing lawmakers and law enforcers engage to finally resolve the harm to competition and consumers in live event ticketing.”</p><p>In January of the previous year, Live Nation and Ticketmaster’s dominance became a focal point in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Live Nation Entertainment’s president and CFO, Joe Berchtold, faced rigorous scrutiny.</p><p><strong>Amanda Lewis, the Secretary of the Fan Fairness Coalition and a Democratic antitrust attorney</strong> emphasized, “When Ticketmaster and Live Nation merged, they created a dominant platform that has made life harder for fans across America. The company uses its power to suck the joy out of fandom, replacing it with frustration, reduced quality, and less choice.</p><p>“From outdated technology and site crashes to limited choices in how, when, or where fans buy and sell tickets, there is no question that fans are worse off today. Media reports indicate the Department of Justice is reportedly investigating harmful practices in this market. We’re encouraged by recent congressional action, including a House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee hearing on the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division and the subpoena issued to Ticketmaster by the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJBoZ3Fnpah6p63NrGScoJGhuaa6xp5kraGToLK1ucCsq56qXZm8rrXNmqWcnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
