Whether it slipped out of your hand while you were on a call or you left it on top of your car when you drove away, the glass is smashed.</p><p>Fortunately, the display still works, and perhaps the touchscreen controls too. So, what do you do now? Here are some things to do right after cracking your phone's screen.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=does-phone-insurance-cover-a-cracked-phone-screen>1. Does Phone Insurance Cover a Cracked Phone Screen?</h2><p>The first thing to do is check if your phone insurance covers cracked phone screens, and under what conditions.</p><p>If so, arranging a fix should be straightforward. In most cases, if your phone screen is broken, the main problem is going to be living without it for a few days. That's as bad as it gets (although you might have to pay an excess charge).</p><p>The problems with cracked smartphone screens start when it transpires you cannot get a replacement screen on the insurance. When this happens, you'll need to take matters into your own hands.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=stop-using-the-phone-with-a-cracked-screen-use-an-old-phone-instead>2. Stop Using the Phone With a Cracked Screen, Use an Old Phone Instead</h2><p>You have a broken phone screen but still need a phone. So, what can you do? Well, a good option is to just use an old phone instead.</p><p>Whether you can’t make calls due to the smashed phone screen, or it has been sent away for repairs, you'll need a replacement. The best place to find one is usually stashed away in the back of a drawer.</p><p>Even if you don't have an old phone you can switch to temporarily, a friend or relative might. Ask, and you'll have a handy replacement until you've decided what to do with your phone and its broken screen.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=put-a-screen-protector-on-a-cracked-screen>3. Put a Screen Protector on a Cracked Screen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/muo-diy-repair-cracked-screen.jpg><p>Wondering if you can put a screen protector on a cracked screen? You can, but you should only do this in certain circumstances.</p><p>For displays where chips and shards of glass are loose or missing, adding a screen protector is pointless. It won't be able to adhere properly as the glass is in motion. The result: you wasted money on a screen protector.</p><p>But where the crack is minimal, putting a screen protector over a cracked screen might help keep the glass from cracking further. It might prevent further spidering.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=how-to-fix-a-cracked-phone-screen>4. How to Fix a Cracked Phone Screen</h2><p>By now, you might have realized (or decided) that you don't actually need a new phone. But how would you go about replacing the screen if you cracked your mobile phone display?</p><p>Thanks to the internet, the chances are you'll find a DIY fix for everything online. <a href=#>iFixIt</a> is a great place to start, as it provides both instructions on how to fix a broken screen, along with links to the parts. Our own guide to <a href=#>repairing a cracked smartphone screen</a> is also worth reading.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>YouTube is another great resource for repair tutorials. Replacement screens can be bought online, via sites like eBay and AliExpress. Benefits of a DIY fix include the keeping down the cost of repair, as well as a feeling of accomplishment.</p><p>It's worth keeping in mind that without the right preparation and skills, you might mess it up.</p><h2 id=pay-for-a-broken-cell-phone-screen-repair>5. Pay for a Broken Cell Phone Screen Repair</h2><p>Uncertainty over DIY (“can I really put a screen protector on a cracked screen?”) might lead you to an alternative solution: paying someone else to do it.</p><p>But how much is it to replace a phone screen?</p><p>While you could ship your phone to the official manufacturer, you're going to pay through the nose for that option. Look at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's repair fees</a> – it's not cheap to get a repair if the cracked screen is out-of-warranty.</p><p>There's probably a local phone repair shop that you can try, and a Google search will show you where to find one, as well as customer reviews. Although you'll probably be paying by the hour, a skilled technician can replace a screen pretty quickly.</p><p>Check the prices and compare the repair shop's competitors before you try them out. Our guide to <a href=#>places that fix broken iPhone screens</a> can help here.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=sell-your-phone-to-fund-a-replacement>6. Sell Your Phone to Fund a Replacement</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/muo-diy-repair-cracked-iphone.jpg><p>Thinking about raising funds for a replacement? Several sites will buy your cracked phone, and even pay for a broken one. These sites include:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SellCell</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gazelle</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gizmogul</a></li></ul><p>You can even <a href=#>sell your broken stuff on eBay</a>? You probably won't get a lot of money for it, but what you do make you can put towards a new phone.</p><p>Many sites will also give you credit for buying a used phone when you trade yours in. You'll probably get a better deal if you take credit instead of cash, so keep that in mind.</p><p>With cash raised, check the web's most popular online stores for a replacement, such as eBay and Amazon. You may even find the same phone in used, but otherwise good condition. Just pay attention to the item description. You don't want to end up buying a damaged phone!</p><p>What should you check? Well, the details should tell you:</p><ul><li>If the phone is working</li><li>Does it have a functioning screen?</li><li>If it has any scratches</li></ul><p>At the right price, buying a like-for-like, second-hand replacement can be a better option than buying a new phone.</p><h2 id=phone-screen-broken-just-buy-a-new-device>7. Phone Screen Broken? Just Buy a New Device!</h2><p>And, of course, the most obvious option: buying a new phone. Sometimes you just need to admit defeat and replace your damaged device.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Sure, it might be painful to spend that much money. But it might be cheaper than buying a replacement and upgrading a few months later anyway. Instead of upgrading soon, it might be best to just do it now.</p><p>If you do decide to buy a new phone, don't automatically buy one from your carrier. Buy an unlocked version instead; it'll save you a lot of money, even though it seems more expensive.</p><p>If you’re looking for a new phone, take a look at our <a href=#>best budget smartphones</a> list.</p><h2 id=just-put-up-with-your-broken-phone-screen>8. Just Put Up With Your Broken Phone Screen</h2><p>Short of money? Not keen on DIY solutions or paying for repairs?</p><p>If your phone is still working, and the screen doesn't appear to be in danger of completely falling apart, why not just keep using it? Sure, it'll be annoying to look at for a bit, but you'll get used to it.</p><p>Saving the money it would cost for a new phone is always nice. If you're on a contract that's soon expiring, this is your best option. You can always put a piece of sticky tape across the crack in the screen. Keep your phone otherwise protected with a protective case, and it should see you through to the next upgrade.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=don-39-t-let-a-broken-phone-screen-ruin-your-day>Don't Let a Broken Phone Screen Ruin Your Day</h2><p>While broken smartphone displays are frustrating, ugly, and kill your phone's resell value, don't let it cast a shadow. A broken smartphone screen is merely a challenge to be overcome.</p><p>Now you know what to do with a cracked phone screen:</p><li>Claim on your phone insurance</li><li>Find or borrow an old phone</li><li>You can put a screen protector on a cracked screen</li><li>Repair the cracked screen yourself</li><li>Pay for the screen to be repaired</li><li>Trade in or sell the phone and buy a replacement</li><li>Contact your carrier for an upgrade</li><li>Carry on using your phone</li><p>Eventually your phone is going to be replaced, so if the other options don't work out, have a fall-back plan. You might contact the carrier for an upgrade, or simply carry on using the phone with the damaged screen.</p><p>When the time comes to move on from the phone, don't just throw it in a drawer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fbHqxvsCcq6KbkaF6tbTIp56sZamkwm6%2Fx6ispZxdmbxurcWtnKtlk6eupLfIp55msZ%2Bqv26%2FzJqpraiYpLumv4ysmqudlaOEbrzRmpqtoZOWuW7Ax6KloKtdrry2edKhpq6klGKxsHnAn6ueql2uvLZ5wquYnKNdrry2voyspJqqpKW1sLrErGSsm6Kasq97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
