Taylor sounded off about the series at his eponymously named bar in Studio City, California, where he in real-time provided commentary on an episode of VPR into a microphone, and repeatedly blasted the show where he got his start."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Show me a scripted show and I'll show you f**king Vanderpump Rules. Scripted! Scripted!"</p><p>"I've been on this show for nine f--king years, this is scripted," Taylor continued, referencing time on the series -- while Taylor is now starring on the VPR spinoff series, <a href=#><strong>The Valley</strong></a>, he was let go from Vanderpump Rules by Bravo in 2020 ahead of season 9.</p><p>"l'll be on next week, and I'll tell you what: it was scripted!" he shouted.</p><p>Taylor has made a few appearances on VPR this season, including an awkward chat with Lisa Tuesday, during which she shamed him for calling her "superfluous" now that the show no longer revolves around her businesses.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9cea9772-3b85-4d32-966d-2095897960c6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:a4098a91-873a-48d0-819f-4c306a08dc1b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c5/5by4/2024/04/22/c5b6e16772564344af8cedff3d73e705_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lisa Vanderpump Calls Out Disrespectful, 'F--king Hypocrite' Jax Taylor In Vanderpump Rules Return</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Taylor denied the claims, adding that he didn't even know the word "superfluous."</p><p>"This is disastrous," Jax said, continuing to rant during his live recap. "Don't get me wrong, when we started, it was awesome. About seasons 1 through 6, it was organic, it was real. Now everybody starts to have money, now it becomes fake. Everything after six seasons is a wash, it's a f--king wash."</p><p>"Now you have a real show!" he added when The Valley came on the bar's televisions. "Back to where we started. It's organic, it's real."</p><p>In a new interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Entertainment Tonight</strong></a>, Vanderpump -- who serves as executive producer on both VPR and The Valley -- responded to Taylor's salacious claims,</p><p>"I think it's absolutely ridiculous to say 'scripted,'" Vanderpump shot back. "Nobody can write a script like Vanderpump Rules."</p><p>"Oh my goodness," she continued. "Maybe what Jax says is scripted. Maybe he sits at home, in his little bedroom and writes his own scripts. Well, what do I know? Anyway, for the most part, anything Jax says doesn't make any sense to me."</p><p>After the clip went viral, Taylor walked back the comments on his podcast, <a href=#><strong>When Reality Hits</strong></a>, alongside estranged wife, <a href=#><strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong></a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1ff424a7-c602-4faf-882c-cdce0419ee1e data-container-ref=toofab:article:a4098a91-873a-48d0-819f-4c306a08dc1b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7f/5by4/2024/04/22/7fa6b9a505b245ce9ef45d9b49cb5ffe_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Scheana Shay Explodes on Tom Sandoval for Weaponizing Her Past Affair on Vanderpump Rules</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I have a big mouth, and it gets me in trouble from time to time,' Taylor told listeners. "I regretfully went on a rant about how Vanderpump Rules is scripted. I'm incredibly embarrassed by that.”</p><p>Taylor then, changing his tune, went on to praise the show for being "the most authentic" reality series out there, especially in the midst of Scandoval, the fallout of which continues to play out on Season 11.</p><p>While things seem as tense as ever amongst the group as <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a> attempts to repair his relationships with his former friends and co-workers after cheating on longtime girlfriend, <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a>, with <a href=#><strong>Rachel Leviss</strong></a>, Vanderpump said she knows whatever happens, the group can always come back together.</p><p>"They can always come back from it," Vanderpump maintained after being asked about the show's explosive season 11 reunion, which she taped last month. "This group has been so divided so many times, and you would think that this one would never talk to that one again and, somehow, they manage to find their way back to each other."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:666e5f3d-c96b-4e81-a663-4671a075d9a9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:a4098a91-873a-48d0-819f-4c306a08dc1b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/05/5by4/2024/04/22/052e6dec40ee43daa4fe91840ba7ae2e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Brock Davies Breaks Down Over Estrangement from Two Kids In Australia on Vanderpump Rules</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While it's hard to imagine Madix and Sandoval co-existing for much longer in the same space, Vanderpump said there's still a lot explore should the show come back for a 12th season.</p><p>"I just think people are so attached to this cast, and there's always a story to tell," she offered. "So we'll see. We'll know when the time is right [to shake things up]."</p><p>Vanderpump Rules airs Tuesdays on Bravo, and is available to stream the following day on Peacock.</p><a id=gallery-link-7ddbee8d-588a-4448-aa20-d5f70df051cf class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:7ddbee8d-588a-4448-aa20-d5f70df051cf data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:a4098a91-873a-48d0-819f-4c306a08dc1b data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/62/4by3/2024/04/02/62f3b6bc084f43cf8e000c61d775a660_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma21foba0rYyvmKeclae9trnPZqqlmZ2oequt12armrGcpL9urcWtnKtlmJp6pLjAoqSsZaaWu6Wx0amspqhdp8KtsdJmoKxlo5i%2FqrzTnpto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
