Sajak asked the man's competitors.</h2><p>One <a href=#>"Wheel of Fortune"</a> winner got quite the surprise out of host <a href=#>Pat Sajak</a> this week.</p><p>On Tuesday's episode, one of the contestants -- an Aloha shirt-wearing man named Fred -- revealed he was a drama teacher, bar trivia host and professional wrestler. He shared he didn't get paid a whole lot for that latter gig, but was in it "for the fun."</p><p>The contestant did so well on the show that Sajak jokingly dubbed the episode "The Fred Fletcher Jackson Show." The host even told Fred's competitors, "To you two, I want to say, it happens sometimes, someone just gets really hot" -- before offering to "body slam" Jackson on behalf of the losers.</p><p>"It very rarely happens that we get someone who just swept everything," Sajak told him ahead of the final round -- which he also solved correctly, leading to an impressive total of $75,800.</p><p>As Fred celebrated his win, Sajak then ran back onto the stage, pulled the contestant's arm behind his back and attempted to put him in a headlock.</p><p>After his big win and totally perfect game, Jackson said he was "shellshocked" by his winnings.</p><p>"I honestly didn't expect to get even one, let alone all of them," he said in a backstage interview with Pat's 28-year-old daughter Maggie Sajak. "Dreams can come true, because mine just did."</p><p>Maggie also asked what Fred thought of her dad's "wrestling skills," with Jackson saying, "He got me. Genuinely, I was trying to counter his hammer lock that he had me in. I wasn't going anywhere."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xma2tfpa61edKaoZqjXamupLfLnqpmr5iasq15zp9kn6eiqcKvsYycpqeslajBorrTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
