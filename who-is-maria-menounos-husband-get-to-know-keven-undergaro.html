The stunning TV personality has had endless love and support from the writer for more than two decades, especially as they’ve embarked on their journey to parenthood.</p><p>Maria and Keven first met on the set of the film they were working on when she was a 19-year-old college student. Speaking with <a href=#>Yahoo Lifestyle</a> in 2018, the entertainer revealed “it was love at first sight” and dished the reason they established such a strong bond right off the bat. “[Keven and I] both had family dramas. We definitely clung to each other and became closer,” she explained. “I think we realized very quickly we had each other’s backs.”</p><p>Maria and Keven became a couple by the late 1990s, but it would be more than two decades before they tied the knot. During their relationship, they experienced plenty of ups and downs, including the former Access Hollywood host’s <a href=#>battle with a brain tumor</a>. “I realized that my health has to be first and that <a href=#>life is really short</a>,” Maria once exclusively told Closer.</p><p>The longtime lovebirds eventually <a href=#>got engaged</a> in March 2016, and the following year, they made their romance official in a beautiful wedding ceremony. After battling the brain tumor, the Fantastic Four actress <a href=#>knew she wanted to become a mom</a>. “We kind of want to have twins and get it over with,” she jokingly told Closer, “but we’ll see.”</p><p>It looked like Maria’s wish was coming true as she announced the two were “going to have a family” during a January 2021 episode of her Better Together show, noting they were planning to move to Nashville. “We want to raise them somewhere where there will be kids next door to play with and you’re not afraid. L.A. just doesn’t have that,” she shared.</p><p>Shortly after revealing the news, Maria clarified to <a href=#>People</a> that they were “not pregnant yet,” but hoping to have a successful surrogacy by the end of “next year.” The Chasing Maria Menounos alum gave an update on her journey to motherhood in July of that year, revealing finding a surrogate was “not working” for them at the time.</p><p>“I thought we’d have the surrogacy thing down. We’d be implanted by now,” she <a href=#>said on her YouTube series</a>. “I thought we’d have something exciting by the holidays, or just after the holidays … but that’s not happening.”</p><p>Fortunately, Maria and Keven had each other to lean on during the tough times. The couple was over the moon to announce<span> they were expecting their first child together via surrogate in February 2023.</span></p><p><span>“Just after a decade of trying everything, we are so grateful to the beautiful family helping us conceive our baby,” Maria told </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span> at the time. “Keven, my dad and I are all beyond excited for this soul to come into our lives. What a blessing.”</span></p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to learn more about the star’s husband.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlmah6rq3RophmpZWjvLa6zqxkoa2jl66vsIygnK1lpKR6rLrOsGSknaaau27BzZ2cq5%2BRp7xw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
