You’re in luck.</p><p>The BBC crime drama first debuted in 2014 and has amassed a dedicated fanbase over the span of just two seasons. After a seven-year gap, the Sally Wainwright-created series is back for its third and final season. Ironically titled Happy Valley, the show tells the story of <a href=# rel=noopener>police sergeant</a> Catherine Cawood and how her tumultuous work and home lives interweave, with a harmonious cocktail of humor and gripping drama.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p><span>In response to why it’s been such a long break between the second and third seasons, Wainwright told </span><a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a><span>: “It was always the plan to leave the gap because I wanted Ryan [</span><span>Rhys Connah] </span><span>to be <a href=# rel=noopener>old enough</a> and have agency in the world to make his own decisions and form his own opinions that aren’t a childish reaction,” she said. “So, more or less the right amount of time has elapsed. He was nine in the last series and he’s 16 in this series. I think if he’d been any younger, it would have felt a bit less credible, but he is now able to make choices and be slightly more independent.”</span></p><p>Here’s how to watch <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Happy Valley in the US</a> for free to see why <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Esquire</a> called it “better than anything HBO or FX or AMC or any of the streamers has produced in a decade” and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Independent</a> dubbed it “one of British television’s greatest sagas.”</p><h2>How to watch Happy Valley&nbsp;in the US</h2><p>How can one watch <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Happy Valley</a><i>&nbsp;</i>in the US?

Catherine Carwood is still coming to terms with the suicide of her teenage daughter, Becky, eight years earlier. Like we said before, ironic title. Becky became pregnant as a result of a brutal rape and delivered a son, Ryan, whom Catherine looks after along with her sister, Clare, who is a recovering addict. Becky took her own life shortly after Ryan was born.</p><p>Throughout the seasons’ six episodes each, Catherine’s lives as a police officer and grieving, vengeful mother intertwine in the most genius way. It’s what makes this show such compelling viewing and an absolute must if you’ve gotten tired of the same old police dramas.</p><h2>Who’s in the cast of&nbsp;Happy Valley?</h2><p>The cast of the BAFTA-winning series is small but the beauty is that we really get to know these characters across three short seasons. Here’s the total list:</p><ul><li>Sarah Lancashire&nbsp;as Sgt Catherine Cawood</li><li>Siobhan Finneran&nbsp;as Clare Cartwright</li><li>Charlie Murphy&nbsp;as Ann Gallagher</li><li>James Norton&nbsp;as Tommy Lee Royce</li><li>George Costigan&nbsp;as Nevison Gallagher</li></ul><h2>How many seasons of Happy Valley are there?</h2><p>There are three seasons of Happy Valley and Wainwright has made it clear there’ll be no more. “We made a definite decision that this was going to be the final season,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">RadioTimes</a> on January 15, 2023. “Just because it’s been successful, we weren’t going to let it drift on until it became a pale shadow of itself.”</p><p>Happy Valley is available to stream on BBC’s iPlayer with a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">VPN</a> Here are the <a href=# rel=noopener>best free VPNs</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png alt="StyleCaster Shopping Newsletter Sign Up" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
