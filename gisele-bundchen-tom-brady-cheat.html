She went on to explain that she wasn’t interested in all the gossip surrounding her love life, telling the outlet, “I really don’t want to make my life a tabloid. I don’t want to open myself up to all of that.”</p><p><a href=# data-type=post data-id=1618810>Bündchen&nbsp;and Brady</a> met on a blind date in December 2006. The pair dated for a few years before tying the knot in February 2009, and eventually went on to welcome two children: a son, Benjamin, born in 2009, and a daughter, Vivian, who they welcomed in 2012. Bündchen was also a stepmother to Brady’s son Jack, who he had with his ex-wife, actress&nbsp;Bridget Moynahan. While they lasted for 13 years as a married couple, Bündchen and Brady ultimately&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1642820>filed for divorce</a> in October 2022. On the same day of their divorce filing, their marriage was declared to be “irretrievably broken” and was dissolved.</p><p>During her interview with the Times, Bündchen seemingly described her marriage with Brady as an “unhealthy relationship.” While she did not mention Brady directly, she made the comment while discussing the criticism she faced in the wake of their divorce.</p><p>“This is something that happens to a lot of women who get blamed when they have the courage to leave an unhealthy relationship and are labeled as being unfaithful,” she said of the cheating rumors. “They have to deal with their communities. They have to deal with their family.” She added, “Of course for me, it just happens to be a little bit amplified.”</p><p>Bündchen also noted in the interview, “No one really knows what happens between two people, only the two people in the relationship.”</p><p>As for her current boyfriend, Bündchen gave some insight into how their romantic relationship started. “This is the first time I am seeing someone that was a friend of mine first. It’s very different. It is very honest, and it’s very transparent,” she said of Valente, who she has been dating since June 2023.</p><p>Our mission at StyleCaster is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
