Can’t wait to share with you all on @ABCNewsLive & @GMA soon … thanks for holding down the fort @Wx_Max @SamWnek @SamChampion,” Ginger wrote on X on Wednesday, February 28.</p><p>The following day, Ginger once again shared another update on what she was doing. “Off the grid. Can’t wait to share soon,” the newscaster, who shares kids Adrian and Miles with husband <strong>Ben Aaron</strong>, wrote on X.</p><p>“You better not be leaving!” one person replied. Ginger confirmed she will be returning to the show after someone wrote, “Miss you on GMA, hope you’re back on soon.”</p><p>“Thanks Mark! I’m back Monday. Earth month coming up so I’ve got some huge stories to bring you soon,” she penned.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46smKZlk52urrzIqKVmqpWrsqK40mauoZ2knbKzec6rZKenpGK1pnnIrGSbmZOgerC6jKCkmmWWqrmtedOipJ5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
