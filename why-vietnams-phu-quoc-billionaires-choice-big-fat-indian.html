Patil, who works for a food and agri-business company, said one downside was having to be more selective with the guest list, because Indian weddings were generally larger and had more guests than their Vietnamese counterparts.
Forget Phuket, here’s Phu Quoc, Vietnam’s big tourism hope
His wedding in Vietnam had about 300 guests and cost about US$60,000."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After opening for over a month, the island has welcomed over 1,000 foreign tourists from countries including Thailand, Laos, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, going by official data. It is a modest intake compared to 2019, when there were 5.3 million visitors, most of whom were Vietnamese.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the same year, the tourism industry earned US$32.8 billion. In the five years up to and including 2019, Chinese, Koreans and Japanese were the most frequent visitors, according to the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism. In recent years, Chinese visitors alone have accounted for around a third of inbound tourists, while those from India made up less than 1 per cent.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">The destination wedding trend could be a game-changerJyoti Mayal</figure><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">A big fat wedding boost</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vietnamese tourism figures have been making capital out of an Indian billionaire couple’s 2019 lavish wedding in Phu Quoc.

These industry mega events gather vendors, hotel managers, event planners and other travel industry figures to promote their packages and elevate the international profile of individual countries as travel and event hotspots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/21/205935b0-9400-42e4-a3a3-ef3b6eb92664_df577e2e.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She raised concerns about pigeonholing Phu Quoc as a wedding destination only for rich Indians.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If Phu Quoc became a destination for all Indian billionaires then that is not sustainable development,” said Ngoc, founder of Virtual Desire Events, a Ho Chi Minh City-based e-commerce platform for event planners and vendors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Besides, when we promote Phu Quoc as a destination for expensive weddings, the main beneficiaries will be branded hotels, not local actors. We are using the five-star hotels to attract people, not the destination itself where those hotels are.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If Phu Quoc and Vietnam tourism as a whole wants to improve, it has to come from the government’s investment, from the smallest actions like participating in a trade show to show that we are working hard to promote our destination.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Added Ngoc: “Vietnam is not short of quality service providers.
