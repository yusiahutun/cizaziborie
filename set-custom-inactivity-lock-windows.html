It could be in the office, at a conference venue, or on the go at your favorite café. And there'll be times you just need to get up to attend to something pressing.</p><p>Fortunately, you can set your PC to lock automatically after a custom amount of time without activity. This means you can safely leave your work desk, knowing your work is safe from prying eyes.</p><p>Of course, you can also lock your PC manually when you walk away from it—just press the <strong>Win + L</strong> keys together or <strong>Ctrl + Alt + Del</strong> and then sign out. But you could miss doing that in a rush, or if you're distracted.</p><p>Instead, check out these methods to configure your Windows PC to lock automatically when there is no activity after a specific amount of time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-lock-your-windows-pc-after-a-set-time-via-the-local-security-policy>1. How to Lock Your Windows PC After a Set Time via the Local Security Policy</h2><p>Using the Local Security Policy, you can set the exact time in seconds after which your PC will lock itself automatically. Make sure you're signed in as an administrator to automatically lock your PC.</p><p>Local Security Policy is only available in the Windows 10 and 11 Pro, Education, and Enterprise editions. If you're using the Home version, skip to method two.</p><li>Type <strong>Local Security Policy</strong> in Windows Search. Click the <strong>Local Security Policy</strong> under <strong>Best match</strong> to open it. Alternatively, press the <strong>Win + R</strong> keys together to open the <strong>Run</strong> box. Type <strong>secpol.msc</strong> in the <strong>Open</strong> navigation bar and click <strong>OK</strong> or hit <strong>Enter</strong> to launch it.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/open-local-security-policy-via-run.jpg></li><li>Click the down arrow next to <strong>Local Policies</strong> in the left pane to expand it.</li><li>Click on <strong>Security Options</strong> to open it.</li><li>The Security Options will open up in the right pane. Now scroll down to the policy named <strong>Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit </strong>and double-click on it to open its properties.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/select-machine-inactivity-limit-in-security-options.jpg></li><li>Under the section <strong>Machine will be locked after</strong>, enter the time in seconds after which you want your PC to get locked automatically. This time is the time of machine inactivity or the time when your PC is idle. You can enter the time between <strong>0</strong> to <strong>599940</strong> seconds. For this tutorial, we'll enter <strong>300 seconds</strong> which is five minutes. Now click on <strong>Apply</strong> and then <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Finally, close the Local Security Policy window and restart your computer for the change to take effect.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, when you use your PC, you will experience that your PC will lock itself after your custom timer expires. And if someone tries to unlock your PC while you're gone, it'll ask them for your password, which should keep them at bay until you get back.</p><p>If you ever want to reverse this action and not have your PC lock automatically, just open the <strong>Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit</strong> policy in <strong>Local Security Policy</strong>. Then just change the time or seconds to <strong>0</strong>—this is the default setting and will not lock your PC automatically.</p><h2 id=how-to-lock-your-windows-pc-after-a-specific-amount-of-inactivity-via-the-registry-editor>2.
