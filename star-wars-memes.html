We’re about to Leia it on thick with this list of the <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1748876>best </a><a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1748876 rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars</a><a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1748876> memes</a>. So, whether you’re here to celebrate May the 4th or just want to keep the Force strong year-round, keep scrolling ahead for the perfect additions to bring balance to your meme collection.</p><p>Star Wars isn’t just a saga; it’s a way of life. From Tatooine to Endor, from Coruscant to Dagobah, fans everywhere know that Star Wars is more than a series of intergalactic films—it’s a cultural phenomenon that transcends generations. And what better way to embrace that spirit than through memes that combine humor, nostalgia, and a touch of the Dark Side? As you read on ahead, you’ll find jokes that capture the wit and wisdom of Yoda, the charm and roguishness of Han Solo, and the sheer audacity of Darth Vader.</p><p>Whether you’re a master of the high ground like Obi-Wan Kenobi or a faithful sidekick like Chewbacca, there’s a meme here that will speak to you. And if you’re feeling a little out of place, remember, you’re never alone—just like the Millennium Falcon always has room for one more smuggler, our meme collection welcomes every Star Wars fan, no matter which side of the Force you lean toward. From Ewok puns to Sith-inspired sarcasm, we’ve got it all. Seriously, these memes are hotter than Mustafar and more delightful than a dance with Ewoks on Endor. Too much? OK, we hope you get the point.</p><p>If anyone asks, you can always tell them you found these memes in a galaxy far, far away—after all, even Jedi need a little mystery in their lives—but you can always <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1774043>share this page</a> with them to enjoy, too.</p><p>Without any further ado, it’s time to grab your blasters, hop in your starfighter, and get ready to laugh your way through the cosmos. Keep on scrolling ahead for the best Star Wars memes on this side of the galaxy!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=best-star-wars-memes>Best Star Wars Memes</h2><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8536585365854><h2>Who is this "Dark" Vader you speak of?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>On one side, you’ve got the die-hard Star Wars aficionado—the type who can recite every line from The Empire Strikes Back, knows the difference between a TIE fighter and a TIE interceptor, and considers midichlorians a hot topic at parties. On the other hand, you’ve got the casual fan who says “Dark Vader” instead of Darth Vader. Classic rookie mistake… almost as bad as people who call Chewbacca a bear. But hey, everyone starts somewhere!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.3955357142857><h2>Even Jedi have to keep their contacts updated</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In the Star Wars saga, Anakin’s fall to the dark side and his renaming as “Darth Vader” by Emperor Palpatine is a pretty serious and dramatic turning point. It’s bad enough that Obi-Wan had to witness Anakin’s betrayal during Order 66. Imagine a Star Wars universe with smartphones, where he’d have to update his Padawan’s contact card now that he’s, well, a Sith Lord. That’s gotta be worse than renaming your ex’s contact name to “Don’t Pick Up.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.6592797783934><h2>Well, that certainly explains the movie order</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>When Star Wars: A New Hope first hit theaters in 1977, it was designated as Episode IV. This was followed by The Empire Strikes Back (Episode V) in 1980, and Return of the Jedi (Episode VI) in 1983. It wasn’t until the late 1990s and early 2000s that the prequel trilogy—Episodes I, II, and III—was released, starting with The Phantom Menace in 1999. It would make perfect sense that Yoda, our wise and backwards speaking Jedi Master, was the mastermind behind this release order! Duh!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.43729903536977><h2>The Force is strong with this one</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Be honest: how many times have you waved your hand at an automatic door, pretending to use the Force to open it just like a Jedi? Same, same. This scene with Luke Skywalker from Return of the Jedi is all of us, even if just for a moment.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.6674698795181><h2>Talk about Rebel Scum</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"></figure><p>As we all know, this meme taps into the dramatic revelation in The Empire Strikes Back where Darth Vader learns that the rebel who destroyed the Death Star is none other than Luke Skywalker, his son. Who knew there was some overlap with Alan Clark’s 1979 grim British prison flick, Scum, and a galaxy far, far away!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8544776119403><h2>Definitely getting a second date after that</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>We all know this iconic monologue from Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. In this scene, Emperor Palpatine, then known as Chancellor Palpatine, tells Anakin Skywalker about the Sith legend of Darth Plagueis, a powerful Sith Lord who could supposedly cheat death. It’s a major moment, marking the beginning of Anakin’s seduction to the dark side. Forget about the small talk on your date—impress them with this Star Wars lore instead.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Credits will do just fine</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>We all knew those fight scenes from Revenge of the Sith were highly choreographed—but who knew they were good enough for the strip club? Here we see Anakin in a setting that is decidedly not the same as his Mustafar duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi. Maybe it was less about his Sith ambitions and more about funding a side gig, after all.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.3652073732719><h2>Time to use the Force to make it turn green</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>This meme shows Qui-Gon Jinn, the Jedi Master from Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, surrounded by the red glowing orbs of the planet Coruscant’s Senate building. In this scene, he’s sitting cross-legged and meditating. May we all take a hint and channel our inner Jedi to maintain our composure, even in the face of rush hour traffic.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8617021276596><h2>Even with CAPTCHA, Obi-Wan has the high ground</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Despite his skill and potential, we all know Anakin was never really considered a Jedi Master. This was crucial plot point in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, where Anakin was denied the rank of Jedi Master by the Jedi Council, ultimately contributing to his eventual turn to the dark side. Even CAPTCHA seems to know this, with Obi-Wan getting thrown in the mix as the true Jedi Master. But as with all of these bot tests, some of us might still get tripped up!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8343949044586><h2>This is awkward</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>After their climactic duel in Revenge of the Sith, Obi-Wan Kenobi leaves Anakin Skywalker severely injured (obviously, we learn he survived the battle after all). Padme Amidala, who was deeply in love with Anakin and unaware of his transformation into Darth Vader, later asks Obi-Wan Kenobi about Anakin’s fate. He’s all right, sure—as long as that means burning to a crisp on the volcanic slopes of Mustafar.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.90823529411765><h2>The resemblance is uncanny</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi, Jabba’s patience with Han Solo over an unpaid debt has run thin, so he puts a bounty on his head and eventually freezes him in carbonite once he’s captured. If Han was to see this purse, you already know he would be beelining in the opposite direction… lest it start asking him why he fried poor Greedo.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.2492857142857><h2>Guilty as charged</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>We all remember this scene from Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope, when an older Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by Sir Alec Guinness, reveals his true identity to Luke Skywalker. The exchange happens after R2-D2 plays Princess Leia’s holographic message for Obi-Wan, where she refers to him as “General Kenobi.” Luke, unaware of Obi-Wan’s history, asks if he knows the General Kenobi that Leia mentioned. Obi-Wan responds with a smile and the line, “Well, of course I know him, he’s me.” Turns out, this quote has plenty of real world applications—and being the guilty party of a Star Wars shopping spree happens to be one of them.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.7459283387622><h2>Now all you need is a light saber</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Take it from Emperor Palpatine, sometimes you just gotta “let the hate flow through you.” This famous quote is from Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi. It’s part of a pivotal scene where Palpatine, the dark and manipulative Sith Lord, is attempting to turn Luke Skywalker to the dark side of the Force.</p><p>During this scene, Palpatine is encouraging Luke to give in to his anger and hatred, knowing that these negative emotions are the path to the dark side. As Luke’s conflict with Darth Vader intensifies, Palpatine urges him to let his hate take over, which would ultimately lead to his fall from the Light Side and his transformation into a Sith. Obviously, we’re not recommending becoming so evil that you’d wipe out an entire empire—but we’re also not not recommending some “aggressive feelings” from time to time.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.2650602409639><h2>My mind, you must change</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Remember Yoda’s famous quote? In Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back, the Jedi Master imparts his words of wisdom to Luke Skywalker, who has traveled to the planet Dagobah be trained to become a Jedi himself. Yoda asks Luke to use the Force to lift his X-wing starfighter from a swamp where it has sunk. Luke, doubting he can accomplish such a seemingly impossible task, says he’ll try to do it. This is where Yoda delivers his iconic line: “Do or do not, there is no try.”</p><p>The message is clear—commitment, confidence, and belief in one’s abilities are fundamental to mastering the Force. We’re pretty sure there’s no changing Yoda’s mind on this one!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.2763636363636><h2>New whip just dropped</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The Sandcrawler is a large, mobile vehicle used by the Jawas, primarily seen in Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope. These massive, tank-like vehicles are used by the Jawas to traverse the deserts of Tatooine as they search for scrap metal and droids to salvage and sell. If Elon Musk is looking for design inspiration for the next Tesla release, this is a great place to start.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.792><h2>I have a bad feeling about this</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>As fans know, the original trilogy (Episodes IV-VI) set the groundwork for the prequels (Episodes I-III), which means that characters who don’t appear in the original trilogy could be written off by various means—usually by death or other, uh, tragic events. Apparently, even heartbreak. RIP Padmé.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.72043010752688><h2>Aren't you a little short for a Stormtrooper?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"></figure><p>But really, what kind of world would Star Wars be if Imperial Stormtroopers were… metric? That’s some good ol’ measurement unit humor for you.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.7098831030818><h2>Speaking of height...</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>We all remember the “I have the high ground” quote from Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. It is spoken by Obi-Wan Kenobi during his lightsaber duel with Anakin Skywalker on Mustafar. As the duel reaches its climax, Obi-Wan and Anakin find themselves on a sloped surface near a river of lava. Obi-Wan leaps to a higher vantage point, gaining a clear advantage over Anakin, who is in a lower position. At that moment, Obi-Wan warns Anakin not to continue the fight, saying, “It’s over, Anakin. I have the high ground.”</p><p>Unfortunately, you know what happens next: Anakin’s pride led him to ignore Obi-Wan’s warning and Obi-Wan strikes him mid-air, severing his limbs and leaving him to die in the burning lava. While we can’t say a relationship with a Short King would end in the same tragedy, at least you’ll always have the high ground on your side!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8375><h2>That's one way to set the mood</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>You’ve heard the “Imperial March.” Also known as “Darth Vader’s Theme,” it’s one of the most recognizable pieces of music associated with the series and is often used to represent the incoming of the Galactic Empire, especially Darth Vader. The track first appeared in Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back, and now, you can share it on your dating playlists, too. Talk about a catch.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.37658227848101><h2>What's in a name?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Personally, we’re a fan of X-Wing, but Naboo also goes pretty hard at elementary school roll call.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.80597014925373><h2>Taking the road by storm</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>But it will get hit by everything in its sight, and we’re also not making any promises about its ability to stay on the road itself…</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.3375796178344><h2>Lone survivor...</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>As part of the Order 66 directive by Emperor Palpatine, Anakin Skywalker, newly named Darth Vader, was tasked with eliminating the Jedi within the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. This included the younglings—young Jedi initiates who were training to become Padawans. In one of the Revenge of the Sith’s most chilling scenes, a group of younglings seek refuge from the chaos and look to Anakin for guidance and protection.</p><p>However, Anakin, now fully turned to the dark side, ignites his lightsaber. The scene cuts away, but it’s clear from context and later references that he killed them. Except… this one kid who was in the bathroom the whole time, apparently. As one commenter wrote, “These jokes will never get old… just like the younglings.” Dark, we know.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.71985815602837><h2>Gotta save space for the things that really matter</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"></figure><p>Some might argue that Rose could’ve made some space and knocked that sequel trilogy into the water, but we’ll let you be the judge of that…</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>He fumbled the bag</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>We all know it’s Anakin’s fault for losing Padme. I mean, she literally dies of a broken heart after his turn to the Dark Side. While it’s not the best justification to become a Sith Lord, I guess everyone has their reasons!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.2565632458234><h2>Sleepiness is strong with this one</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"></figure><p><br>This adorable Yoda scene takes place in Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back toward the end of the film, after Luke has received extensive training from Yoda. Yoda, burdened by the weight of guiding a new generation of Jedi, closes his eyes to take a nap—and honestly, we couldn’t relate more.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.3121990369181><h2>It's tough out there</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Anakin was denied the rank of Jedi Master despite being given a seat on the Jedi Council by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in Revenge of the Sith. His emotional volatility, attachments, and disregard for Jedi teachings concerned the Council, as did his his increasing closeness to Chancellor Palpatine. Suffice to say: Anakin had some red flags, and anyone could notice it. It’s hard out there for a rejected Jedi.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1.0458167330677><h2>We didn't say it was a good thing</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>At least there’s always the option of joining the Dark Side, am I right?</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9695723684211><h2>Deal or no deal</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"></figure><p>In Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back, Darth Vader made a deal with Lando Calrissian, the administrator of Cloud City, to betray Han Solo and his friends in exchange for not disrupting Cloud City’s operations. However, Vader ultimately changes the terms of the deal—unsurprising for an evil Sith Lord. Lando has no choice but to comply, just like us Star Wars fans, as we deal with plot holes and changing storylines throughout the years.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.668016194332><h2>It's just semantics</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><br>Obi-Wan Kenobi served as a General during the Clone Wars, as depicted in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, and in the animated series, Star Wars: The Clone Wars. During this time, Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters were given military titles and responsibilities to lead the Grand Army of the Republic against the Separatist forces. As a General, Obi-Wan commanded clone troopers in battle and was involved in significant military operations across the galaxy. But if we’re really being specific…well, see the meme above.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1.2214285714286><h2>It was an inside job</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>And you’re telling me the one who had the plans to the Death Star also happened to be Darth Vader’s daughter? These guys may be onto something…</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfqMGivoywmKurXaKyrrHSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
