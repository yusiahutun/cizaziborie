The most cursory of Google searches leads one on a tour of Greek lahanodolmathes, stuffed with ground beef and rice and covered with a traditional egg and lemon (avgolemono) sauce; French chou farci, stuffed with beef or pork, sometimes mushrooms, wrapped in large layers of cabbage leaves and served in wedges; Polish gloabki, or “little pigeons,” with pork and beef, and rice or barley (sigh); Slovak holubky or halupki; Serb or Croatian sarma with (hold me) sauerkraut and ham hocks, and Arabic mahshi malfouf which adds lemon juice, cinnamon and mint (swoon) to the usual ground meat and rice medley. And guys, I’m just getting started. The idea that there are this many ways to fall in love with stuffed cabbage torments me, and leaves me daydreaming about a <a href=#>Westeros</a>-length winter wherein we could audition each one.</p><p><a title="quickly blanching the cabbage leaves" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8235/8483762827_8b90d79e83_z.jpg alt="quickly blanching the cabbage leaves" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a title="limp cabbage leaves, draining" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8511/8483763023_4877b22cb4_z.jpg alt="limp cabbage leaves, draining" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="a hunk of old whole wheat sourdough" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8225/8483763261_dec19a275f_z.jpg alt="a hunk of old whole wheat sourdough" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="torn up bread, mashed with milk" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8391/8484858058_b3cac4d774_z.jpg alt="torn up bread, mashed with milk" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="pare the stem if it's too thick" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8109/8484858240_d0bf90209f_z.jpg alt="pare the stem if it's too thick" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="meatball center" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8248/8483763813_5e1fa44daa_z.jpg alt="meatball center" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>For today, however, I am just going to take you to Italy, via Vancouver, in a tiny, wonderful restaurant called <a href=#>La Quercia</a>, where everything I thought I knew about stuffed cabbage was hatched open by a single appetizer shared by a group in a sea of dishes that was so delicious, I am not sure anyone but me noticed. But still, I haven’t been able to forget it. I did what I always do when an idea obsesses me, I jotted it near the top on a list of recipe ideas that I swear, stretches longer than Manhattan right now, and vowed to find my way back to it as soon as possible. It wasn’t even necessary, because three months later, it came to me, when <a href=#>my favorite English person in Rome</a> wrote about none other than <a href=#>mondeghini in/al sugo</a>.</p><p><a title="pin it shut with a toothpick" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8388/8483763919_cf29518147_z.jpg alt="pin it shut with a toothpick" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="line them up" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8520/8484858766_0b38cd2621_z.jpg alt="line them up" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="pinned packets" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8507/8483764327_587e9b5029_z.jpg alt="pinned packets" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>You could say I ran to the kitchen. And yet, when a dish torments you as long as this one has and you finally have a potential path to unlocking its greatness at home, am I the only one who melodramatically fears disappointment? Will this really be it at last? Will it take another twenty rounds to get it right — will the perfectly seasoned, tender, featherlight meatballs wrapped lovingly inside a gorgeous doily of a cabbage leaf all still elude me? Will it have the simple sauce, flecked with bright, plump tomato bits? Or will be the a cruel victory, a dish that’s in fact perfect, but such a pest to make that you’ll only do so once a year.</p><p><a title='"chopping" the tomatoes' href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8243/8484859118_637160394c_z.jpg alt='"chopping" the tomatoes' data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="parcels, about to simmer" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8370/8483764731_0264d6e82f_z.jpg alt="parcels, about to simmer" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Not this one; this one exceeded every expectation. Not only did it taste exactly as good as I remembered it, but it was the easiest stuffed cabbage I have ever made: there’s just about nothing to chop, no pile of mirepoix that you must work your knife through, again and again. You really don’t saute a thing; there are no chopped onions that are promised to soften and sweeten in 5 minutes but actually take 15. There were no false promise of profound flavor that fall weakly on the plate. My goodness, even the (currently) <a href=#>pickiest three year-old on earth</a> applauded these “meatballs,” and when this happens, I encourage you to buy double what you need, because you’ll be making it again that very week.</p><p><a title="stuffed cabbage in tomato sauce" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8239/8483764953_535f914f2f_z.jpg alt="stuffed cabbage in tomato sauce" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Double Coconut Muffins</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>White and Dark Hearted Brownies</a> and <a href=#>Green Bean Salad with Frieds Almonds</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Chocolate Souffle Cupcakes with Mint White Chocolate Cream</a> and <a href=#>Spaghetti with Cheese and Black Pepper</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Toasted Coconut Shortbread</a>, <a href=#>Devil’s Chicken Thighs</a> and <a href=#>Hot Fudge Sauce</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Seven Yolk Pasta Dough</a>, <a href=#>Best Chocolate Pudding</a>, <a href=#>Pasta Puttanesca + Broken Artichoke Hearts Salad</a><br><b>Six years ago:</b> <a href=#>Mom’s Chocolate Chip Meringues</a> and <a href=#>Vegetable Dumplings</a></p><p><strong>Italian Stuffed Cabbage [Mondeghini al sugo]</strong><br>Adapted from <a href=#>Rachel Eats</a>, who adapted it from from Giorgio Locatelli’s recipe in <a href=#>Made in Italy</a> and Jane Grigson’s <a href=#>Vegetable Book</a>.</p><p>This dish is a mid-winter delight, budget-minded, not terribly complicated to make, hearty and delicious — wilted cabbage leaves, a tender meatball and a simple, bright sauce. It went instantly into our rotation of favorite cold-weather dishes.</p><p>The recipe’s original measurements were in metrics; I have done my best to translate them, but not accurately as I made some tweaks (slightly higher proportion of sausage to bread, etc.) to taste.</p><p>For the bread, you can use white bread (as originally called for) or whatever you have around. I had a day-old hunk of whole wheat sourdough miche that was absolutely delicious in here, and I was happy to rescue it. If necessary, the bread can be soaked in water instead of milk. Chicken sausage could probably replace the pork nicely. And if you’re like me, and totally forgot to get fresh herbs, and skip them, nothing terrible happens since the sausage should already be well-seasoned. Cabbage rolls are typically formed like an egg roll — folded in sides, rolled up filling — but I was so taken by the packets we had in Vancouver, wrapped almost like a wine bottle and pinned at the top for cooking only, that I wanted to emulate that here. Any shape will work.</p><p>Makes approximately 12 cabbage rolls; a serving can range from 2 (petitely) to 3 per person. I took Rachel’s lead and served it with mashed potatoes; <a href=#>these</a> are decadent.</p><p>1 large savoy cabbage<br>7-ounce (200-gram) hunk of bread (see above), crusts cut away, torn into small scraps (you’ll have about 3 loose cups of scraps)<br>2/3 cup (approximately 150 ml) whole milk<br>14 ounces (400 grams) or approximately 4 plain pork sausages (I used sweet — i.e. non-spicy — Italian), casings removed<br>1 small sprig of sage, finely chopped<br>1 small sprig of rosemary, finely chopped<br>2 tablespoons grated parmesan<br>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste<br>1 28-ounce can peeled plum tomatoes<br>2 tablespoons (30 ml) olive oil<br>1 clove garlic, peeled and minced</p><p>Prepare cabbage: Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Discard any messy or broken outer cabbage leaves and carefully peel 12 nice, large leaves. (I think the cabbage can tell if you’re in a rush, and will tear more easily. Work carefully. That said, a torn leaf will hardly ruin the dish.) Blanch leaves for about 30 seconds to 1 minute (you can do a few at at time), until wilted, and spread out on towels so that they dry and cool.</p><p>Make filling: Place bread scraps in bottom of large bowl and pour milk over. Let sit for a few minutes, then mash it gently with a spoon until something close to a paste forms. Mix with sausage meat, herbs, parmesan and a pinch or two of salt and black pepper; I find this easiest with a fork or bare hands.</p><p>Make the cabbage rolls: Lay your first cabbage leaf on the counter. If it doesn’t want to lay flat, pare away some of the thickest stalk (with a paring knife or vegetable peeler) to make it easier. Form some of the filling mixture into a golf ball-sized round. Wrap cabbage leaf around it (see Note about shape up top) and pin at the top with a toothpick. Repeat with remaining leaves and mixture.</p><p>Make the sauce: To prepare your tomatoes, either break them up with your hands (for bigger chunks), run them through a food mill or roughly chop them right in their can with scissors (what I did here). In a heavy saute pan with a lid or a medium (5 to 6-quart) Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute for about 30 seconds (just until golden, not a moment longer) then add the tomatoes, bringing the sauce to a gently boil. Season with salt if needed. Add cabbage packages, arranging them carefully in the pan so they all fit, cover the pot and gently simmer them for 25 minutes. Remove the toothpicks and carefully turn the rolls over, cooking them for another 25. Remove the lid and simmer for another 10 minutes to cook off some of the wetness. They’re all cooked now, but if you can rest them for another 15 minutes before eating them, the flavors settle and they become even better.</p><p>Okay, <i>now</i> you can dig in. Repeat frequently, yes?</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-9716 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-9716 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
