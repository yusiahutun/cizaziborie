Phase 1 of The Food Home capital campaign will fund the project’s Urban Farm, which combines education and urban agriculture by allowing for year-round produce to be grown through aquaponics and hydroponics systems, along with training opportunities on these new technologies.</p><p>The Urban Farm’s self-sustaining business model will see local fresh produce grown for sale to local distributors and vendors, while ensuring the availability of fresh produce to be set aside for local residents in need. Features will include cutting-edge growing facilities that will house aquaponics, hydroponics, and aeroponics systems; The Hardesty Community Corner gathering and event space; and a teaching facility to develop future urban agriculture professionals using the aGrow Future curriculum. Through a partnership with Tulsa Public Schools, Food On The Move has already laid the foundation for the project at North Tulsa’s Monroe Demonstration Academy. Through their aGrow First program, students have been introduced to a greater understanding of community health along with means to use these principles to combat food deserts and food insecurity.</p><p>“Our concept with Food On The Move was if we could forge relationships, understand the community through pop-up events, pay-as-you-can mobile events, bringing fresh produce to where the greatest need was,” says Hanson, “we’d have the best chance at understanding the long-term solutions needed and the long-term answer to how to transform a food desert into an oasis.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ39wfZBoamlnpJbGrbvRZp%2BapqOku7R5xaimnWWfo3q1tMRmpKiulWK5osHNnJ%2Beq12jsrh5waugp59dm7ywsIyhpqadXZiurrzAop6nZaSkeqS7zJuYrWWWpLylecinqp6bpae2tcWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
