However, they were discontinued and replaced by Snapchat Charms.

They're not viewable if someone's blocked or hasn't accepted your request.

Regardless, <strong>It's Their Birthday!</strong> charm signifies that it's your friend's birthday; <strong>Birthday Twins</strong> indicates you and your friend have birthdays less than seven days apart.

If two people are born under the same sign, Snapchat awards them with <strong>It's a Sign </strong>charm. The <strong>Astrological Sign</strong> charm gives insight into your friend's personality and which unique qualities they possess based on their sign.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similarly, the <strong>Sun Sign Compatibility </strong>charm assesses compatibility based on both of your signs. It's a fun way to learn what the stars say about your friendship. The <strong>Friend's Birthstone</strong> charm illustrates your friend's birthday month with its respective birthstone. For example, a shimmering, blue Aquamarine stone signifies all March birthdays.</p><p>This is just one of the ways you can enjoy the <a href=#>astrology profile features on Snapchat</a>.</p><h3 id=joining-snapchat-charms>Joining Snapchat Charms</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/since-way-back.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/joined-in-2015.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/joined-in-2016-3.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Snapchat's all about commemorating the beginning of user's journey on the app. It's why the app assigns users different charms based on the year they signed up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Snap OGs</strong> are those who have been using Snapchat since 2013, the year Snapchat launched Stories.
