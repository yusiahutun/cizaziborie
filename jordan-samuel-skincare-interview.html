The cult-favorite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Jordan Samuel Skin</a> product line soon came afterwards, adopting the facialist's signature less is more approach to skincare.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, we chat with Pacitti about skincare trends, why there's more to good skin than the products in your routine, and more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What inspired you to get into skincare?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A lot of people say they got into skincare because they had skin issues growing up, but I didn't experience that so I had no idea how to take care of my skin. Then I became a professional ballet dancer and my skin went haywire. When I started performing professionally, we would do upwards of eight shows a week, which meant putting on stage makeup, removing it, putting it back on if we had a matinee and evening show, and then taking it off again. My skin became super irritated, raw, sensitive, and broken out. I needed help, so I used my maintenance money allotment from the ballet company to get facials. I really got into the therapeutic aspect of it, as well as learning about what ingredients and products worked best for my skin. I ended up breaking my left and right foot two years apart, and when I was out for recovery, I started thinking about what my next move would be. At that time, a new aesthetics school opened up in Seattle (where I was living), and it seemed like the writing was on the wall. I started working in a spa, then in product education for Kate Somerville, and then opened my private practice. I quickly realized some of the buy-ins for the brands I wanted to use were so extreme and not accessible to everyone, so I decided to invest in myself and start my product line.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Your line prioritizes formula above everything else. How do you create the products?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">COVID has really thrown a wrench in how I do things, but it usually starts in the treatment room. A number of clients come in and at a certain point, you start hearing or seeing the same things. Yes, everyone's skin is different, but that's really what I tap into in terms of creation. There's probably a product out there, but it's priced absurdly or maybe it's not a pleasure to use. That's also part of the initial groundwork. From there, I go to one of the chemists I work with and they'll come back with something and then we really dig in. My preference to focus on formula over marketing also comes from the treatment room where I'm educating clients on skincare and how to make their skin better. And even though we say we're further apart with social media, I also feel like it's allowed me to be more accessible to people right now because I can respond to comments on Instagram or emails. So even if we're not in a treatment room together, there's still a way to educate people that wasn't there 10-15 years ago.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>You don't just educate your followers on ingredients and products, but also how internal factors like how emotions impact the skin. Why is this important to share?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I would have clients who were on really great programs for their face talk about the extreme stress they were going through when they came in, and I could see it in their skin. I'm obviously not a doctor, but I've talked to doctors about this. I see a lot of people get really frustrated and spend too much on a product that's either masking their issue or not doing anything, so they keep switching to something else. It's always nuanced because everybody is different, but your skin health is much bigger than just your daily regimen. We're talking stress, environment, and even diet. It's important to let people know they don't have to go run out and buy a new set of products, they need to get to the root of the problem. While it might not be in everybody's budget, I always recommend going to an aesthetician or dermatologist because the amount of money spent there will save people money in the future by not purchasing products blindly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Everyone's skin is different, but what is one product from your line that all skin types can benefit from?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hydrate Facial Serum</a> is one of our best sellers and it's the second product I created. It can work for super oily, acne-prone skin to dry, sensitive skin. You can use it as a serum or a booster by putting a few drops into your moisturizer. The formula isn't solely based on hyaluronic acid, it also has glycerin, cucumber and aloe leaf extracts, and vitamin C. And now, between the over-cleansing and over-exfoliating, and even something as simple as extreme weather, it will help add hydration to the skin — even if it's not used daily, but just at certain points throughout the year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: InStyle On: Best Beauty Buys</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What is one skincare trend you want to see die and what is something you wish would become popular?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This trend of focusing on single ingredients rather than the whole formula is something I'd like to see die because people get hell-bent on them, and instead of using a single product, they end up using six. It's created a buying frenzy, and more often than not, creates further skin issues and concerns. It's usually in the form of sensitized, irritated, and confused skin where it's dry on top and oily underneath, for example. For me, the focus on single ingredients is never going to be the answer. It's always going to come down to the whole formula.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Something I'd like to see come out of this is a less is more approach to skin. There is not one person I've had a pleasure of working with that I haven't stripped back their routine or put them on a really straightforward, simplified routine. I would love to see this be the direction because it's better for the environment and it's also better for the skin in general. It creates less confusion and concerns for everybody.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shop-jordan-samuel-skincare-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shop Jordan Samuel Skincare Products</span></h2><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-after-show-treatment-cleanser></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The After Show Treatment Cleanser</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the show comes the after party, and after that, it's time to wash your face.
